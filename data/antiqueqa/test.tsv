how can we get concentration onsomething?	In biology, a hypotonic cell environment is an environment with a lower concentration of solutes than the cytoplasm of the cell. In a hypotonic environment, osmosis causes a net flow of water into the cell, causing the swelling and expansion of the cell. This swelling may lead to the bursting of the cell.. . In summary, a hypertonic solution contains a higher concentration compared to the cell. Hypotonic means it has a lower concentration compared to the cell. Isotonic is a situation in which the concentrations of the cell and of the solution are in an equal ratio.. . You could get more information from the link below...	0	2
how can we get concentration onsomething?	A Hypotonic solution is one in which the concentration of electrolyte is below that in cells. In this situation osmotic pressure leads to the migration of water into the cells, in an attempt to equalize the electrolyte concentration inside and outside the cell walls. If the difference in concentration is significant, the cell walls may rupture, leading to the death of the cell. Consequently, it is vital that the electrolyte concentration of liquids used during blood transfusions be matched to that in cells.	0	1

Why doesn't the water fall off  earth if it's round?	This goes along with the question of why don't we fall off the earth if it is round. The answer is because gravity is holding us (and the water) down.	1	4
Why doesn't the water fall off  earth if it's round?	one thing you might want to consider with this one is the center of mass, since that is where the bulk of the pull from gravity will come. Try it out with a basketball/any spherical object. If you put your finger on the surface and were pulled in to the center, look at the direction your finger would have to move: straight down, not off the edge.	1	3
Why doesn't the water fall off  earth if it's round?	Why don't we fall off?  Simple, gravity.  Large objects have a natural gravitational pull...  Earth is a LARGE object haha  A very large object.  So Earth is just pulling water towards it.	1	4
Why doesn't the water fall off  earth if it's round?	same reason why people in south (e.g australia) don't fall off earth - earth's gravitational pull.	1	4
Why doesn't the water fall off  earth if it's round?	The same reason a drop of mercury in a bowl is round. 'Round' is the most stable state. It's the only configuration that gets the most 'earth' closest to the center and uses up the most gravitational potential energy. You can see how this works by imagining an avalanche. The rocks move as close as they can toward the center of the earth by falling and along with erosion, tends to make the earth even more 'rounder'.	0	2

Why doesn't the water fall off  earth if it's round?	Every object attract and repulse one another. In small bodies such forces have almost no effect because forces are very feeble.Whereas in huge celestial bodies attraction and repulsions are considerable.So earth has been attracting the moon as well as repulsing.Also centrifugal and the centripetal  forces have existed  due to revolution around the earth is  helpful in keeping moon`s orbit.Actually moon is moving towards the earth very slowly.When it comes relatively closer to earth after millions of years moon has to revolve faster to maintain its orbit.Also as it comes nearer to earth it cannot withstand interaction of repulsion attraction of earth hence blasts out into pieces. These pieces will  once again revolve round the earth in different orbits. Small pieces may fall on earth as asteroids.You may wonder  how intelligently the nature is protecting the earth.	0	2
Why doesn't the water fall off  earth if it's round?	its a hypothesis but its said that meteorites that were frozen (all meteorites are a mix of frozen rock, iron and a lot of FROZEN H20)started to fall down to earth, the the frozen water started to melt and thats how also the athmosphere formed and there arent any more meteorites coming down to earth.	0	1

Why doesn't the water fall off  earth if it's round?	they are not. . if a drop of water were weightless (as in space)  the surface tension would pull the droplet together with equal force all the way round,  and form a sphere.. . when falling through air however there is drag involved and this distorts the sphere to form a droplet shape	0	2
Why doesn't the water fall off  earth if it's round?	They are meteorites that have come into the Earth atmosphere and light up because of the friction that they have with the Earth’s atmosphere.  They do not always fall to the ground though, some times they skip off the atmosphere like a flat stone skips off of a body of water when thrown correctly, other times it burns up before it reaches the ground.	0	1
How do I determine the charge of the iron ion in FeCl3?	Since chloride is an halogen, it has a charge of -1.. Because a molecule always have a charge of zero, the iron must be a positive charge..

How do I determine the charge of the iron ion in FeCl3?	+3. Since each Cl is -1 and there are 3 Cl needed to make the whole molecule neutral then the Fe must have a charge of +3 because:. -1(3) + 3 = 0	1	4
How do I determine the charge of the iron ion in FeCl3?	"Use the ""kriss-cross method"".  Just kris-cross the subscripts of each element, and add the proper charge in front of the numbers.  Remember, FeCl3 is saying:  Fe1Cl3, so just switch and put on the top the 1 and the 3.  And then add the + or - charge sign.  Iron is always positive, as are all metals (except perhaps hydrides), and chlorine is always -1, as are all of the Group 7  (halogens) elements."	1	4
How do I determine the charge of the iron ion in FeCl3?	For any ionic compound, you need to know the charges that certain atoms possess.  For chlorine and all other halogens, the charge is always -1.  . . So, we have two things that we definitely know:. . 1) EACH Cl has a charge of -1.. 2) The net charge of FeCl3 is 0 (since it has no superscript).. . So.... . NET CHARGE = (charge of atom #1)(number of that atom) + (charge of atom #2)(number of atom #2) + .... . And for FeCl3.... . 0 = (charge of Fe)(1 atom) + (-1)(3). . ** charge of Fe = +3.  **. . . . You can see that the net charge of all three chlorines alone give -3.  These chlorines and the Fe3+ give a net charge of 0 for the entire molecule.  . . You can check your work by realizing that Fe3+ only has two charge forms: Fe3+, and Fe2+.	1	4
How do I determine the charge of the iron ion in FeCl3?	charge of Fe in Fecl3 is 3. . iron has either 2 as valancy or 3. in this case it bonds with three chlorine molecules. therefore its valency and charge is three.	1	4
How do I determine the charge of the iron ion in FeCl3?	If you imagine a small 1 as the subscript for Fe then you can criss-cross the subscripts and make them superscripts and those will be the charges. So you have Fe1Cl3. and you criss-cross the charges to get Fe3+ and Cl-1. so the charge on the iron ion is +3	1	4
How do I determine the charge of the iron ion in FeCl3?	do u mean how do u destinguish which roman numeral to use?. . well u have to find out the charge of the other side of the equation. for example, FeO, rust, is called 'Iron (II) Oxide' because oxygen has a negative 2 charge, so iron will have a positive 2 charge to balance it out. . also remember, 2 is the charge of each individual iron atom, so if there were 2 iron atoms(Fe2O), then it would be called Iron (I) Oxide because the charge of each iron atom is positive 1	1	3

How do I determine the charge of the iron ion in FeCl3?	Nails are made of metallic iron which is silvery if you ignore the oxide coating.. Iron tablets contain ionic iron which looks very different and depends on what the iron is ionically bonded to. For example Iron Sulphate is ionic iron bonded to a sulphate ion and is a blue liquid or crystal. The ionic compound in your tablets are some other from of iron based ionic compound and I don't know exactly what that is. . . So metallic iron and ionic iron look and feel very different even though they are basically the same atom.	1	4
How do I determine the charge of the iron ion in FeCl3?	NaCl IS NOT TWO ATOMS (sodium and chlorine) BONDED TOGETHER!. . NaCl is what is known in chemistry as an ionic salt.  That means that a very positively charged Na+ ion met up with a very negatively charged Cl- ion, and because opposite charges attract, they got close to each other in what is known as an ionic bond, which isn't really a bond, just two particles hanging out together.	0	2
How do I determine the charge of the iron ion in FeCl3?	You can find the answer from the atomic number. The atomic number tells you about the number of protons in an element. If the atom is neutral(i.e non-ionic), the number of protons equal number of electrons. If it is a negative ion, or known as anion, add the charge to the number of protons,to find electrons. If it is a positive ion, or cation, you subtract the charge from the proton to find the number of electrons in the ion. Ion is a charged element or atom.	1	4
How do I determine the charge of the iron ion in FeCl3?	The number of protons is equal to the atomic number of an atom.  To determine the number of electrons, first determine if there is a charge to that atom (making it an ion if it is not zero).  For each + charge, subtract one from the atomic number for the number of electrons.  For each - charge, add one.  Therefore, . . Na has 11 electrons, Na(+) has 10 . . Mg has 12, Mg(2+) has 10 . . F has 9, F(-) has 10. . O has 8, O(2-) has 10. . And no, I am not hooked on 10, just seemed convenient to use the same target.	1	4
How do I determine the charge of the iron ion in FeCl3?	Hard water has Calcium hardness and magnesium hardness. The two together are total hardness. Chlorine, rust, chloromines, iron and etc are not part of hardness. Rust is oxidized iron.. . Ion exchange is used to soften water. In a home a softner contains resin beads that attract the total hardness ions. When the resin can hold no more, a saltwater brine cycle kicks in to regenerate the resin. . . Hard water is generally noticaable with a buildup on faucets, sinks, glassware, windows, and cars.. . The test for hardness is simple .It is called a titration test and is EPA approved. . .

How do I determine the charge of the iron ion in FeCl3?	It has to do with the alignment of charge due to unidirectional striking force- The same thing will happen to any iron bar after a hard strike-the force generated causes (usually temporary) alignment of enough atoms to generate magnetism. In a normal bar of iron, the atoms are aligned more or less at random, so there is no cumulative directional magnetic force- Any time a significantly large proportion of atoms are aligned together, the summation of the electromagnetic charges can be detected.  Rotating a piece of metal will not induce magnetic charge.  Exposing iron to an extremely powerful magnetic field will, because it will cause alignment of the atoms in the iron, but the magnetic field of the Earth (inside, outside, everywhere) is extremely weak.	0	2

The poison enters the food chain and carries on killing.. Buy traps, bait them with chocolate or gravy on a piece of bread and leave them against the walls and skirting.. If you use the live box traps you have to release the mice about a mile from your house or they come back. Mice can also freeze or starve to death in them so check them every morning.	1	4

I have mice.How do I get rid of them humanely?	If you are seriously looking for a humane way to rid your house of mice, the only option is live traps. These catch the mice inside a box-like structure so you can release them elsewhere, preferably somewhere far from any houses. People usually have mixed results with these. You could also just get regular spring mouse traps. They usually kill the animal instantly, by breaking their spinal cord. Just be sure to check them often.. You also need to understand how the other methods work in order to pick the right one. Rat poison doesn't cause dehydration, but instead it causes internal bleeding, until the animal eventually dies. MAKE SURE TO KEEP THIS AWAY FROM PETS OR LIVESTOCK-- THEY WILL AFFECT THEM THE SAME WAY. and treatment is expensive.  Glue traps work by trapping the animal and waiting for them to starve to death or dehydrate. Can also be harmful for pets. If you have any further questions, feel free to contact me.	1	4

Febreeze can also help if you use a lot of it after you wash offending area with a 10:1 dilution of bleach. To get rid of the cats you may have to ask your nearest Humane Society for some humane traps to catch these strays even if they  do or don't have an owner.

"What does ""see Leaflet"" mean on Ept Pregnancy test?"	One of the first signs of pregnancy is a late period. But missed periods do not necessarily mean that you are pregnant. If you’re sexually active and have missed a period, then it is worthwhile to take a pregnancy test. You may still want to take a pregnancy test even if you have been using contraception. Since birth control can fail, taking a pregnancy test will allow you to rule out one of the possible causes of missed periods. Your local pregnancy center can provide a test for free. . . If you have a late period and a negative pregnancy test, then consider whether or not you’ve recently been sick, gained or lost a significant amount of weight, have been under excessive stress or have taken any new medications. All of these things can affect your menstrual cycle and cause you to have irregular periods.

what is innate immunity?	If you are asking about antibodies attacking non self, this is essentially immunology.. The body is designed to try and kill anything that is non self (ie bacteria, parasites, virus infected cells etc) The body does this by recognising molecules on the invading organism as non self and consequently destroys the cell by a number of mechanisms within the body, some of these are simple innate mechanisms, where the cell is essentially eating by cells such as macrophages, or there are more complex mechanisms known as the adaptive immune system which can include antibody production and cytotoxic t cells. Antibodies themself are not able to attack molecules, but essentially act as a signal to cells within the immune system that something is foreign.... Hope this helps!!!. Katie	1	3

Success in anything comes from FINDING WHAT WORKS then DOING WHAT WORKS.. . I am going to reveal to you the Secret Weight Loss Formula that Celebrity personal trainer don’t want you to know about.. . Before I reveal the secret, first I need to explain to you that there is process that your body goes through to burn body fat. . . So how does your body burn fat?. . It is a 2 steps process and in order you need to:. 1.Release the fat from the fat cells and only then. 2.You can burn the fat. . . That process is the same for every human being. I will outline the steps and then show you how you can easily apply some fundamental rules to allow your body to burn the maximum amount of fat with less effort and minimum time. Once you understand that simple process, you can easily see why you are not getting the results that you want. Even bigger, you will finally see that getting that dream body is getting so much closer to reality that you will be extremely motivated to get started as soon as you can.. . How does your body release the fat from the cells?. . Before you can turn your body into a fat burning machine, here what needs to happen: your body fat need to be released from the fat cells. You can accomplish this step successfully with your nutrition program. Here are some specific tips that you can apply right away to achieve that.. . 1.Eat 4-6 small, frequent meals and never skip meals.. 2.Include small amounts of good fats.. 3.Eat natural foods; avoid processed & refined foods. 4.Eat lean proteins with each meal.. 5.Eat more complex carbs, fruits & vegetables.. . The most misunderstood weight loss strategy. How to burn the *fat* instead of burning muscles.. . Releasing fat from the fat cells is not the end of it; actually, it is just the beginning. Because the fat needs to be transported from the fat cells to your muscles so it can be burned there. This is done through your blood and the cardiovascular system is responsible for that. The more effective is that system, the more effective your body will become at burning fat. You can improve your cardio vascular system by doing so cardio training.  However, don’t go out yet and spend 1 hour on the treadmill because you probably not going to be doing too much good like that.. . The reason is excessive cardio combined with a restrictive diet burns fat but mostly muscle tissue. That is not a good thing at all, because muscle tissue is where you burn the fat and if you are burning away muscle tissue, you are burning your ability to burn more fat in the future (weight loss plateau). You just don’t cut the hand that feed you. So cardio burns fat and it can also burn muscle tissue, this is a huge dilemma. Damn if you do, damn if you don’t. But wait there is a solution to that…. . You need to do some MODERATE cardio training. The key word here is moderate. . Doing too much cardio can be detrimental and I am sure you have seen those people that are doing cardio on a daily basis and still not getting anywhere. The result is a low metabolism. Low metabolism means, your body fat is not going anywhere, anytime . soon. Here is what you need to do:. . 1.Do some moderate cardio training; the key word here is moderate. 2.Never diet but consume little fewer calories that you will burn (No starvation diets, Please...). . The world most efficient “fat burner” is FREE and You already have it.. . Before I reveal to you how personal trainer get those celebrities in the best shape of their life in such short period there is one more thing that I want you to understand. Because it is very important. . Weight loss marketers always claim that they have the magic “fat burner” that will melt your fat away.

how can i lose 30 pounds by june3?	Try melatonin.. . You may find Melatonin in health food stores, pharmacies, and some supermarkets. It comes in a number of forms and a wide variety of dosages, so make sure to examine the labels carefully and select a product that contains the proper dosage for dogs. Make sure that it does NOT contain other herbs or nutrients. The usual dosage is 3 mg for a dog that weighs over 30 pounds. In a few cases, very large dogs weighing well over 100 pounds needed 6 mg, but that's unusual. For dogs that weigh less than 30 pounds, give 1.5 mg. For a tiny dog, reduce the dosage even further. Keep in mind that 1,000 micrograms (mcg) is equal to 1 milligram (mg), so a 200 mcg pill, which is a common dosage form, contains only 1/15 of the amount recommended for a large dog.	1	3

Gods elect will never commit blasphemy against God.  They love God and want to do His will.  It is said that blasphemy of the Holy Spirit is the unforgivable sin.  God forgives ALL sin.

In funerals they are very supportive as a community, often showing up wether they know the deceased or not. This sometimes seems nice, but on many occasions they do not enter the chapel, they just stand around outside, drink coffee and socialize. . Many of the funerals i attended were for young men. They apperently are very much into driving fast. many of them arent too good at it. . They also use funerals as a way of showcasing their talents. Anyone who thinks they can sing often sings a few songs. . . Its hard to think of many positives, i mostly heard negatives, and mostly from other filipinos.	1	3

How do people get hiccups, what are they, and what exactly is the best way to cure them?	"This is the only real way to instantly cure the hiccups! Look no further! The Hughes/Green method cure's the hiccups EVERY time GUARANTEED! You will be amazed! Hundreds of instantly cured hiccuper's have sent in their testimony's of deliverance! Files are available for researchers! Carefully understand both the HOW and the WHY of this method. If you don't get the WHY you might not get the HOW. Here's how to cure the hiccups:. . ""Hughes/Green Hiccups Cure""© 1997. . (1) Pour a TALL glass of water.. . (2) Hold your breath... ***. . (3) IMPORTANT...PINCH YOUR NOSE CLOSED.. . (4) Slowly, take 10 - 20 swallows of the water...while holding your breath with your nose pinched closed.. . (5) When you can't stand it any more....you'll know by that overwhelming drowning sensation -- after a gasp, take a deep breath and relax.. . This cures the hiccups 99 percent of the time - guaranteed! It's a proven medical remedy! (A second treatment could be necessary for stubborn cases.). . *** For stubborn cases, try EXHALING COMPLETELY and then taking 10 - 20 swallows.. . NOW: HERE'S WHY IT WORKS: Hiccups are caused by an uncontrollable spasm in the diaphragm, (the ""breathing"" muscle). Often, this spasm is triggered by irritable conditions in the smooth muscles of the stomach or the esophagus. The ""Hughes/Green Hiccups Cure"" forces an increase in the carbon dioxide levels in the diaphragm itself, as well as in the stomach and esophagus. By swallowing, you are making the muscles work -- so they use up their available oxygen and replace it with carbon dioxide. By temporarily discontinuing to breath, you prohibit new oxygen from entering your body and thus create an anaerobic condition in the spasming diaphragm muscle. When the spasming diaphragm and stomach are deprived temporarily of oxygen and encounter the higher levels of carbon dioxide ... you feel that scary drowning sensation! BUT this causes the spasming muscles to relax! The hiccups go away! Essentially, you are ""tricking"" your body into thinking that it's drowning ... and it decides to use it's resources for something other than hiccuping. The rather ""scary"" drowning sensation caused by this method is NECESSARY for the method to work. If it's not just a little bit difficult ... it doesn't work."	1	4

Why do our elected federal senators and congressmen not have to live on regular S.S. like the rest of us?	Because Americans have been complacent, and too trusting of elected officials for so long that they have concstructed the laws is such a way that it benefits them more than us (the non-elected citizens).. It is too late to do anything about certain laws they have already passed, but we need to become more watchful of our elected officials.	1	4
Why do our elected federal senators and congressmen not have to live on regular S.S. like the rest of us?	Because they have a strong U.S. lobby and we keep electing pro-Israeli congressmen.. . It's stupid really.	0	2

Why do our elected federal senators and congressmen not have to live on regular S.S. like the rest of us?	They didn't compromise because what you described is not how the US elects presidents.  The Virginia and New Jersey plans were used to establish rules of elected House Representatives and US Senators.  The US subscribed to the Virginia Plan on how it would elect congressional representatives which was by population.  The New Jersey Plan was used to elect Senators--two per state, completely opposite of the Virginia Plan.	0	2
Why do our elected federal senators and congressmen not have to live on regular S.S. like the rest of us?	BRAC is Base Realignment And Closure.  A panel of Senators and Congressmen decide which bases and military units to close down and consolidate.	0	1

When socialist Ted Kennedy ceased control of US education, the downward spiral accelerated at an astronomical rate of speed. If you really care about US education, then write your senators and congressmen demanding that they drastically reduce the amount of government control of education.	0	1
Why do our elected federal senators and congressmen not have to live on regular S.S. like the rest of us?	Because our Congressmen are reelected every 2 years and the Senators are reelected every 6 years, which are staggared so that different senators are up for reelection every 2 years. We hold the midterm elections in order to vote for these officials.	0	2
Why do our elected federal senators and congressmen not have to live on regular S.S. like the rest of us?	Because congressmen and senators won't vote in favor of a law that would limit their own terms.	1	3
Why do our elected federal senators and congressmen not have to live on regular S.S. like the rest of us?	They all take great care to make themselves rich before they leave office.

Hmmmmmm...What's wrong with this picture?	1	3
Why do our elected federal senators and congressmen not have to live on regular S.S. like the rest of us?	I don't know. And I totally agree with everything you said. It is sickening!	0	2
Why do our elected federal senators and congressmen not have to live on regular S.S. like the rest of us?	Um, yeah, sort of.. See, here's what the deal is:  the federal government has reserved for itself the right to enforce immigration law.  That means that regular police officers, city and county governments, etc. have no jurisdiction when it comes to immigration law enforcement.  . The republicans, in charge of the white house *and* congress for the past 6 years, could have passed a law in congress giving immigration enforcement powers to local law enforcement agencies -- but they didn't.  They let the current laws stand, which means regular cops on the street -- even when they come across someone they know is an illegal immigrant -- can't deport them or arrest them simply for being here illegally.  That power rests solely with the federal government.	0	1
Why do our elected federal senators and congressmen not have to live on regular S.S. like the rest of us?	"because the concept of one vote having the ability to make a difference, is hard for us to accept. Elections have recently become so negative that people feel like they are going to vote for the ""Best of the Bad"". Deep down, I think we all want to think our elected officials are a step above the rest, at least morally."	0	1
Why do our elected federal senators and congressmen not have to live on regular S.S. like the rest of us?	yes they can - though they have taken steps to scramble conversations - it is not as easy as before but there is always a chance and if you live in the US, then it is confirmed that our own gov. does it on a regular basis -	0	2
Why do our elected federal senators and congressmen not have to live on regular S.S. like the rest of us?	Most of the previous answers are correct, it takes too much money. . What to do something about it? . . Let's start a DON'T RE-ELECT ANYONE campaign, especially for Federal politics. . . All of out US Senators & Congress people have only one goal. It is the same goal, to be re-elected.  Neither side truly cares about doing the right thing or they'd do it.. . We need to get back to the principals that made our county great. Most all of us have those principals, but until we get back to a system where being elected to serve is a duty, not a livelihood. . At our countries inception it was only the successful landowners or business owners who were elected. Most of them lost their land or business because they were not there to manage it. Yet they served because it was their duty. . VOTE OUT ALL INCUMBENTS.	1	4
Why do our elected federal senators and congressmen not have to live on regular S.S. like the rest of us?	if everybody voted on every issue, it would be a true democracy.  america, however, isn't a democracy.  America is a representative republic.  we vote on our congressmen and senators to fote on our behalf in congress and in the senate.  same thing takes place in state governments and even the town council.   that is why it is very important to vote in every election in your area, so that the person sent to represent you, actually is the person you want.	0	2
Why do our elected federal senators and congressmen not have to live on regular S.S. like the rest of us?	Ideally, the peoples' voice is heard...not the voice of the corporate America.  Since the people are actually the ones who have to live with whatever decisions our elected officials make, it would be nice if they actually listened to the input of the people.  But as long as it is allowed, the 'big money' will be the loud booming voice that is heard over the small quiet voice of the rest of us...	1	3
Why do our elected federal senators and congressmen not have to live on regular S.S. like the rest of us?	Because the only way to remove a sitting president is for him to resign (highly unlikey), or for him to be impeached.  Impeachment requires congress to find him guilty of an offense (like leaking a CIA operative's identity, going to war on false pretenses...)  And then voting to remove him from office.  And the Republican's have controlled congress for his whole term.  This fall, elect Democratic Senators and Congressmen - then there will be more accountability and Bush's actions will be far more limited.  . . Thought I doubt he'll leave office until 2008. . Remember, if Bush were removed.  Cheney would become president.	0	2
Why do our elected federal senators and congressmen not have to live on regular S.S. like the rest of us?	The US is a  republic since we do not vote directly for our federal laws but rather vote for representatives who will determine the laws by which we live. We do not have a democracy which exists only in a few small places, I think in Vermont or New Hampshire where the voters actually vote on everything. . For the rest of us, even at local levels, we vote on the people who will decide for us.	0	2
Why do our elected federal senators and congressmen not have to live on regular S.S. like the rest of us?	The Constitution has it limited to two terms. I think all elected Federal officials should have only one term in office, then unless they run for President, they cannot hold another elected office.. . that would cut down on the life long politicians like Tedd Kennedy, and cut down on the number of them on the take from big business and from Unions.. . Limit them across the board and America would get back to where we should be.	0	2
Why do our elected federal senators and congressmen not have to live on regular S.S. like the rest of us?	I think we all recognize that the differences between the parties are small. The two-party system is also so ingrained that it will be almost impossible to start a 3rd party that can really compete.  . . To me, you should look at your local representatives (State and Federal Congressmen and Senators).  Do those individuals have the same beliefs as you?  If not, work hard to get someone else into their office at the next election.  We cannot change the whole system at once, but we can elect people who are not career politicians, or at least people who have the same beliefs as us, and will fight to fix things, one position at a time.. . It is the politicians currently in office who made it the way it is.  Change them!	0	2
Why do our elected federal senators and congressmen not have to live on regular S.S. like the rest of us?	The Constitution set the term for a Congressman at 2 years so every two years, the whole House must be re-elected.  Senators serve for 6 years and their elections were split into thirds so 1/3 of the Senators has to run every two years.  It helps to keep a balance between stable administration and allow the people to express their concerns on a regular basis.	0	2
Why do our elected federal senators and congressmen not have to live on regular S.S. like the rest of us?	I don't think it's racism that is sparking the illegal immigrant issue.  It's the fact that they don't pay taxes, can't vote, yet their Senators and Congressmen vote for what they want.  Most aren't putting in their fair share.	0	2
Why do our elected federal senators and congressmen not have to live on regular S.S. like the rest of us?	Because the U.S doesn't elect people with vision. The U.S. has little regard for  other countries and education. It's a country that is arrogant and ignorant with a collectively low I.Q and E.Q.. There's no power or money involved in getting elected on this issue.	0	2
Why do our elected federal senators and congressmen not have to live on regular S.S. like the rest of us?	Because the rest of the world needs us to live so they won't do anything that the U.S. government doesn't like.	0	1

why do people judge a dog by what he looks like?	Yeah, pit bulls are great dogs. I blame the media and irresponsible owners for creating the pit bull's image problems. Combine that with increased dog fighting over the last few years and breeders who have no idea what they're doing and you can see what's going wrong.

why do people judge a dog by what he looks like?	People are terrified in general.. . Your dog just makes them scared because he looks like he would be more than they could handle in a physical confrontation.  Therfore they fear and scare your dog with their fear.	0	2
why do people judge a dog by what he looks like?	Because it is our human nature to judge everything we see.	1	3
why do people judge a dog by what he looks like?	Maybe it means that people aren't judged by their looks, manner of dress and their past history.	0	2
why do people judge a dog by what he looks like?	Because that is in our nature. Since we have brains that act on its own at some level, people (brains) tend to judge everything and that is OK and natural and since people do not know anything about the person they meet or see at the very first moment, they will do the automatic judging with the available information they have and that is sight. Let me give you an example that proves judging does not occur when people look at someone and why it is normal. when you hear some singer on the radio for the very first time and you don't know how he or she looks like, you tend to think (judge) that he or she has a certain type of looks depending on her or his voice until you see that person on TV. It is the same thing; people judge you when they look at you because that is all the info that their brain can get at that instance.	1	3
why do people judge a dog by what he looks like?	Do you know what it means to be prejudiced? It means you PRE JUDGE. Don't you see how saying black people are prejudiced is PRE JUDGING?. . Maybe you shouldn't make gross generalizations about a group of people based on their skin color. How would  you like it if someone said that ALL people of your race/ethnicity were a certain way? That's really not cool. People of all races, nationalities, backgrounds pre judge. EVERYBODY does it sometimes (though not necessarily about race).	0	1
why do people judge a dog by what he looks like?	I think it is part of human nature, to judge someone or something. It is a naturally done and so many people do it without knowing it. Its hard to explain, but I think it is easy to judge things that we do not do ourselves because it is different. People do not like different things, of course not all people. So in judging people different then us, we set ourselves apart from others, allowing us to put other people and their idea's down.	1	4

why do people judge a dog by what he looks like?	There is no doubt that some dogs are smarter than others, just like people. Your puppy is a baby and will learn quickly just like a human baby.

why do people judge a dog by what he looks like?	If you are talking about someone you just meet or see, you don't judge them. You never know what someone is like until you can get to know them.

why do people judge a dog by what he looks like?	Your neighbor may be feeding him later at night when you are asleep because if your neighbor was only feeding the dog once a week then the dog would more than likely be dead. He could have an automatic feeder that holds alot of dogfood. If the dog looks like it is skinny, and and starving call the local animal control for neglect of feeding his dog. This is called lack of responsibility to care for his dog, and that is animal neglect and abuse.	0	1

I have a female sex offender living next door to me, but she doesn't even show up on the sex offenders sites, just the male ones. . .

God tells the Muslim to spread the message of Islam, which says that there is only one God, that he has no sons, daughters, mothers, fathers, etc., and that is is He who controls everything within the Heavens and the Earth.  Islam teaches that our sole purpose in life is to worship Him.  So, you see Islam spreading at its rapid pace, yet Islam doesn't carryout missionary activities like the Christians.  Islam is spreading so rapidly (especially in the USA) because of what it teaches -- compassion, equality, justice, etc.. . Islam doesn't need to ""conquer"" anything.  The message speaks for itself."	0	2

how can we stop the spread of islam?	That's a very general statement and it shows bias. Honestly, it depends on the Muslim that you talk to. I know two Muslims who are against terrorism and do not justify it in any way. So, I don't think that all Muslims are brainwashed by the Quran to justify blowing themselves up. I do think, however, that the Quran is far from a sacred book because, when looked into, it DOES justify killing for the spread of Islam (Example: Allah told Muhammad to kill the Quraysh tribe at Mecca because they inhibited the spread of Islam; something like that can never be found in the Bible), and it also justifies the abuse of wives.. So, not all Muslims are crazy or brainwashed by the Quran; the ones I've met are actually quite nice. However, I do think that the Quran isn't a very good book, so Islam is predicated somewhat upon evil. Just my opinion, though.. Again, remember not to make such general, biased statements.	0	2

Many reasons.	0	2
how can we stop the spread of islam?	Actually, your above statement is not true.  A lot of third wold countries with muslim populations struggle with education, but not because of their religion - it's due to their economic situation.. .

You will find that with the rise of Islam centuries ago, Universities flourished and the spread of knowledge travelled like wild fire across the globe.	0	2

The desire for violence, greed and tolerance of suffering (which ensured our survival all those hundreds of thousands of years ago) has been brought with us through the ages and remains at the core of our medula oblongata (the basic fight or flight instinct that controls all creatures).  In short, until man learns or evolves to tame his inner beast, absolute lasting peace is a forgone conclusion left only to the dreamers.	1	3

why do cats headbutt?	Not all cats hate the water. Cats that are native to hot areas seem to enjoy the water like lions, jaguars, and tigers. They enjoy taking dips in a stream to cool off! Who wouldn't? However cats that live in colder climates tend to dislike the water like bobcats, cougars, lynx, and snow leopards. Water damages the ability of the cat's fur to insulate the animal against the cold. This explains why cold weather cats don't like the water and hot weather cats do! Some house cats enjoy playing with the a drippy faucet (I know my cat does!) but it all pretty much varies from cat to cat. And it all depends on it's previous experience.	0	2

How to cook Angus burgers?	You could get a meat thermonmeter and pull the burgers off when they hit about 145 to 150 degrees F in the center.  (The time depends on how thick the burger is.)

The temperture should increase by about 5 degrees while they rest, so food illness is decreased.	1	4

How to cook Angus burgers?	Angus is just a type of ground beef.  They cook the same way as hamburgers.  I would say maybe you don't want to cook them all the way through, but if you do, cook until the juices run clear.  I would say maybe about 4 mins on each side.  Make sure your flame is low, you don't want to char the outside of them before the inside is done.  And watch for flareups, if you cook until the fat runs out, it will flare up and give an off flavor to the burger.  Lastly, you could purchase a food thermometer...140 degrees for medium, and 165 for well done.  Good luck, and email me with any questions!. . OH YEAH!  One more thing...you don't have to make a 'test' burger, you could always just crack it open a little to see the inside, and then serve crack side down on the bun!	1	4

What is the difference between coolant and anti-freeze?	The difference is, coolant is the liquid that curculates through your engine and radiator to cool the engine. Anti freeze is a component of most but not all coolants.Diesel engines use a special antifreeze called Dow Therm. Suzuki motorcycle engines use oil in their engine cooling systems in some of their road bikes like the Intruder line. Auto motive antifreeze must not be put in your cooling system by itself.It is made to be mixed with water to work properly.I usually mix it 50/50 which will protect from freezing to -40 F.	1	4
What is the difference between coolant and anti-freeze?	Anti-freeze	0	1
What is the difference between coolant and anti-freeze?	"I would check the ""Coolant Level Sensor"" first if the cooling system is full of anti-freeze and it is not overheating or showing any signs of leaking! If the sensor has gone bad it will turn the ""Low Coolant Light"" on, but the system will remain full and functional."	0	2
What is the difference between coolant and anti-freeze?	"""Coolant"" is the liquid in the radiator.  It may be pure water, pure antifreeze, or, more commonly, a mixture of the two.. . ""Antifreeze"" is something added to water to lower its freezing point.  For cars and trucks, it is almost always the liquid ethylene glycol."	1	4

What is the difference between coolant and anti-freeze?	They are the same thing. It just does two jobs. It keeps the engine cool in the summer, thus coolant. It keeps he engine from freezing in cold weather, thus antifreeze.	1	4
What is the difference between coolant and anti-freeze?	There is no difference. It is the same substance. It has two different names because it does two different things for your car. It cools it when it's running. And in the winter, it is specially designed not to freeze. If it froze your engine block and radiator would split open.	1	3
What is the difference between coolant and anti-freeze?	"just make sure whatever you're using says ""for automobile use"".  It should be Ethylene Glycol.  Some people say coolant and others say antifreeze.  Go with the chemical name:   you can't go wrong."	1	3
What is the difference between coolant and anti-freeze?	Emergency Vet Hospital NOW!  She could have gotten into anti-freeze and will die within a day without medical attention!	0	1
What is the difference between coolant and anti-freeze?	Coolant IS the more proper term.  Ethylene glycol and, more recently propylene glycol do both perform as anti-freeze, but only when the temperature is below 32 degrees F.. . But whenever your engine is up to operating temperature the mixture in the cooling system performs as coolant.  The obvious task is to cool the engine and carry the heat to the radiator.  But another overlooked function of either of the glycols is to help raise the boiling point of the water.  Remember in science class...anything added to water like that will lower freezing point and also raise boiling point as well.  The pressure cap on the radiator keeps the pressure at from 7 to 15 p. s. i. which increases the boiling point as well.  That way all your water will not boil away quickly.	1	4
What is the difference between coolant and anti-freeze?	also, make sure that no coolant is dripping from your tailpipe. if it is you either have a blown head gasket or a cracked head. freeze plugs can rust through and allow coolant to leak out slowly-thats what happened on my truck causing me to lose coolant.	0	2
What is the difference between coolant and anti-freeze?	After engine shut down coolant temperatures actually will rise for a bit before it cools down. Check the coolant level after it has cooled to be sure it is not over filled. If the proper cold level is there, do not fill the expansion tank full. Engine coolant, when heated will expand and push coolant out of the over flow past the pressure cap. If the coolant level is not the trouble, have the pressure cap tested and if faulty replace. Be sure to use the recommended pressure rated cap. Water boils at 215 degrees F, but with a 50/50 mix anti-freeze and water and a 15 lbs pressure cap the coolant boil point raises to 230 degrees F. See the issue if you have incorrect levels of coolant, incorrect coolant mix or a bad pressure cap? The least cost is check for proper coolant levels, then costs occur from there.	0	2
What is the difference between coolant and anti-freeze?	"Everything will freeze if you turn the temperature down low enough. Amazing as it might sound, Heineken does actually contain alcohol - which has a much lower freezing point than water... so it acts as an anti-freeze.. . [useless fact alert] freezing alcoholic beverages is technically illegal because when they do freeze the ""water"" part of the drink freezes and the ""alcohol"" part stays liquid and can then be poured off. This is basically distillation and is particularly used when making illicit ""whiskey"" by freezing wine (in Ireland they make potato wine and freeze it to make ""poteen"" - potato whiskey... highly illegal and liable to take the top of your head off!)."	0	2
What is the difference between coolant and anti-freeze?	Water is used ONLY if the proper coolant is unavailable.  Water does not have the heat transfer rate that radiator coolants do, i.e prestone coolant.  There is also the problem during winter, with water freezing, when these coolants will not.. . If your radiator has only water in it... you can expect some problems during extreme heat, or cold.	0	2
What is the difference between coolant and anti-freeze?	the cheapest and easy way to tell is to make sure your coolant is full leave the cap off and start the car, if a lot of coolant comes out for a long time it's a bad sign.	0	2
What is the difference between coolant and anti-freeze?	drain the coolant out, drill a hole in the center of the freeze plug, and then thread a screw into the hole and attach it to a slide hammer and pop it out.  If you don't have a slide hammer, you can use a seal remover and insert that into the hole and pry it out.  dont forget to put sealer on the outside edges of the new freeze plug when you install the new one.	0	1

Water cools and heats at a constant rate and that made it reliable as a coolant, plus it was and is readily attainable..   New technology and chemistry started producing other specifically designed coolants to enhance radiator performance and handle extreme hot and freezing temperatures. Thus water is still used but the synthetic coolants are better for radiator and engine life.	0	2
What is the difference between coolant and anti-freeze?	Even if the  sea becomes frozen the fishes in the antartic regions have a special anti-freeze which donot allow  their internal organs to freeze  even if their outer scales start freezing i.e all the processes are going inside their bodies.	0	1
What is the difference between coolant and anti-freeze?	"Actually 2 ways. ""Old man"" way and the Right way.""Old Man"" ""Old School"" way  is to pour small amounts of anti freeze or water thru the intake.Anti freeze or water super heats in the combustion chambers and breaks off the carbon. Your can really damage your engine by doing this. Correct way is to take it to a qualified repair shop. They have the chemicals and equipment to do it properly."	0	2

Why is yawning contagious?	Yawning is contagious because of the “mirror-neuron system,” -- it contains a special type of brain cells, or neurons, that become active both when their owner does something, and when he or she senses someone else doing the same thing.	1	4
Why is yawning contagious?	The reason why we yawn is unexplained.  Believe it or not, it's not done because we are tired or because there is a lack of oxygen in our lungs.  Some socialogists believe that the act of yawning dates back to cave men.  It may have been communication tool, not unlike sign language, that signaled it was time to head back into the caves and rest.  It's sonething that has been passed on from generation to generation and for some reason never faded once other forms of language were developed.	1	3

Why is yawning contagious?	"For other uses, see Yawn (disambiguation).. . . A dog yawning. A yawn (synonyms chasma, oscitation from the Latin verb oscitare, to open the mouth wide[1]) is a reflex of deep inhalation and exhalation associated with being tired, with a need to sleep, or from lack of stimulation. Pandiculation is the term for the act of stretching and yawning. Yawning is a powerful non-verbal message with several possible meanings, depending on the circumstances. It is also claimed to help increase the state of alertness of a person. The exact causes of yawning are still unknown.. . Contents.  [hide]. 1 Origin of the word. 2 Causes of yawning. 3 Contagiousness. 4 Trivia. 5 Superstitions. 6 Notes. 7 External links. [edit]Origin of the word. . The word ""yawn"" has evolved from the Middle English word yanen, an alteration of yonen, or yenen, which in turn comes from the Old English geonian.. [edit]Causes of yawning. . An indication of tiredness, stress, over-work, or boredom.. An action indicating psychological decompression after a state of high alert.. A means of expressing powerful emotions like anger, rejection, apathy or tedium.. Caused by low oxygen in the brain. A yawn can express strong anti-social messages, and so in some cultures people try to mute or mask them by placing a concealing hand over the yawning mouth.. . . A cat yawning. A previous long-standing hypothesis is that yawning is caused by an excess of carbon dioxide and lack of oxygen in the blood. The brain stem detects this and triggers the yawn reflex. The mouth stretches wide and the lungs inhale deeply, bringing oxygen into the lungs and hence to the bloodstream. It is almost certain, however, that this hypothesis is not correct. One study has documented that this effect does not exist.[2]. A more recent hypothesis is that yawning is used for regulation of body temperature. Another hypothesis is that yawns are caused by the same chemicals (neurotransmitters) in the brain that affect emotions, mood, appetite and other phenomena. These chemicals include serotonin, dopamine, glutamic acid and nitric oxide. As more of these compounds are activated in the brain, the frequency of yawning increases. Conversely, a greater presence in the brain of opiate neurotransmitters such as endorphins, reduces the frequency of yawning. Patients taking the serotonin reuptake inhibitor Paxil (Paroxetine HCl) have been observed yawning abnormally often. Another theory is that yawning is similar to stretching. Yawning, like stretching, increases blood pressure and heart rate while also flexing many muscles and joints. It is also theorized that yawning helps redistribute an oil-like substance which coats the lungs and aids breathing. Some have observed that if you try to stifle or prevent a yawn by clenching your jaws shut, the yawn is unsatisfying. As such, the stretching of jaw and face muscles seems to be necessary for a good yawn.. Some movements in psychotherapy such as Re-evaluation Counseling or co-counselling believe that yawning, along with laughter and crying are means of ""discharging"" painful emotion, and therefore can be encouraged in order to promote physical and emotional healing.. [edit]Contagiousness. . The yawn reflex is often described as contagious: if one person yawns, this will cause another person to ""sympathetically"" yawn.[3] The proximate cause for contagious yawning may lie with mirror neurons, i.e. neurons in the frontal cortex of certain vertebrates, which upon being exposed to a stimulus from conspecific (same species) and occasionally interspecific organisms, activates the same regions in the brain[4]. Mirror neurons have been proposed as a driving force for Imitation which lies at the root of much human learning, e.g. language acquisition. Yawning may be an offshoot of the same imitative impulse. At a distal level (in terms of evolutionary advantage), yawning might be a herd instinct.[5] Other theories suggest that the yawn serves to synch"	1	4

Why is yawning contagious?	yawning is contagious....we yawn when we are bored and also when there is inadequate oxygen. this can happen (shortage of oxygen) especially in a room full of people. since oxygen is less we yawn to take in more air (oxygen) which our body requires. and since oxygen is generally in lower levels, other people start yawning aswell.	1	4

Why is yawning contagious?	"Apart from the tired yawns, or the too much CO2 in the lungs yawn there are the embarrased and contagious yawns, these I think are a body language ""erm"""	0	2
Why is yawning contagious?	A yawn is caused by a decreased level of oxygen in your blood.  By taking a deep breath (yawning), more oxygen is going from the air into your blood stream.  When you are tired, your body starts breathing slower.  By yawning, you make up for the decreased levels in oxygen.  I'm not exactly sure on why they are contagious, but it's probably due to a psychological response.  Kind of like when you're sitting at lunch and one person takes a drink.  If you watch for it, other people will take a drink shortly after wards.	1	4
Why is yawning contagious?	It may not be one of life’s deepest mysteries, but as scientific conundrums go, it has a peculiar staying power. Why is yawning contagious? .   Researchers recently found that yawning isn’t only catching among people; it is also among chimpanzees.No one has devised a fully convincing explanation of why.. . Compounding the mystery is the odd way in which the contagious power of yawning is largely unconscious. We can see someone yawn, yearn to replicate the action ourselves, and do it, all without thinking about it. Other times we’re aware it is happening, though it still floats somewhere beneath the realm of reason and of purposeful actions.. . So what gives? In an effort to find the answer, the Finnish government recently funded a brain scanning study. The results turned up some hard-to-interpret, possible clues. It also confirmed the obvious: yawn contagion is largely unconscious. Wherever it might affect the brain, it bypasses the known brain circuitry for consciously analyzing and mimicking other people’s actions.. . This circuitry is called the “mirror-neuron system,” because it contains a special type of brain cells, or neurons, that become active both when their owner does something, and when he or she senses someone else doing the same thing. . . Mirror neurons typically become active when a person consciously imitates an action of someone else, a process associated with learning. But they seem to play no role in yawn contagiousness, the researchers in the new study found. The cells are have no extra activity during contagious yawning compared with during other non-contagious facial movements, they observed.. . Brain activity “associated with viewing another person yawn seems to circumvent the essential parts of the MNS [mirror neuron system], in line with the nature of contagious yawns as automatically released behavioural acts—rather than truly imitated motor patterns that would require detailed action understanding,” wrote the researchers, with the Helsinki University of Technology and the Research Centre Jülich, Germany. The findings are published in the February issue of the research journal Neuroimage.. . But if seeing someone yawn doesn’t activate these centers, what does it do to the brain? The researchers found that it appears to strongly activate at least one brain area, called the superior temporal sulcus. But this activation was unrelated to any desire to yawn in response, so it may be irrelevant to the contagion question, the researchers added.. . Possibly more significant, they wrote, was the apparent deactivation of a second brain area, called the left periamygdalar region. The more strongly a participant reported wanting to yawn in response to another person’s yawn, the stronger was this deactivation. . . “This finding represents the first known neurophysiological signature of perceived yawn contagiousness,” the researchers wrote.. . Exactly what the finding means is less clear, they acknowledged. The periamygdalar region is a zone that lies alongside the amygdala, an almond-shaped structure deep in the brain in the area of the side of the head. The periamygdalar region has been linked to the unconscious analysis of emotional expressions in faces. Why it would be deactivated in tandem with yawn contagion is unclear, the researchers said.. . One thing seems clear from the study is that “contagious yawning does not rely on brain mechanisms of action understanding,” wrote one of the researchers, Riitta Hari of the Helsinki University of Technology, in a recent email. Rather, she continued, it seems to be an “‘automatically’ released (and most likely very archaic) motor pattern,” or sequence of physical actions.. . In the study, volunteers looked at videos of actors yawning or making other mouth movements. Meanwhile their brains were scanned using functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging, a system that shows the amount of activity or work going on in various brain areas ba	1	4
Why is yawning contagious?	"experiments suggest that contagious yawning is related to a person's self-awareness and ability to see things from another person's view. In the words of Dr. Platek and his colleagues:. . ""Seeing or hearing about another person yawn may tap a primitive neurological substrate responsible for self-awareness and empathic modeling which produces a corresponding response in oneself."". The researchers also suggest that animals, such as chimpanzees and orangutans, who are capable of self-recognition and mental state attribution should be susceptible to contagious yawns. Perhaps you can make some observations of such behavior the next time you are at the zoo."	1	4
Why is yawning contagious?	"Dr. Provine suggests that perhaps yawning is like stretching. Yawning and stretching increase blood pressure and heart rate and also flex muscles and joints. Evidence that yawning and stretching may be related comes from the observation that if you try to stifle or prevent a yawn by clenching your jaws shut, the yawn is somewhat ""unsatisfying."" For some reason, the stretching of jaw and face muscles is necessary for a good yawn.. It is possible that yawns are contagious because at one time in evolutionary history, the yawn served to coordinate the social behavior of a group of animals. When one member of the group yawned to signal an event, all the other members of the group also yawned. Yawns may still be contagious these days because of a leftover response (a ""vestigial"" response) that is not used anymore. None of this has been proven true and yawns are still one of the mysteries of the mind."	1	4

It signals tiredness to other members of the group in order to synchronize sleeping patterns and periods of activity. It can serve as a warning in displaying large, canine teeth. This phenomenon has been observed among various primates. The threat gesture is a way of maintaining order in the primates' social structure. The contagion of yawning is interspecific, for example a human yawning in front of a pet dog can incite the dog to yawn as well. Oddly, sometimes sympathetic yawning may be caused by simply looking at a picture of a person or animal yawning, or even seeing the word yawn.. .

why does milk cost more than gas per gallon?	The question you should be asking is how come gasoline is so CHEAP!. . We spend very little for gasoline compared to the other fluids we purchase. . Do realize that we pay.... coffee at starbucks ($40/gallon) . beer ($20/gallon). paint ($15/gallon) . cooking oil ($12/gallon). gatorade ($6/gallon) . soda ($3/gallon). Milk ($2.86/gallon). Orange Juice ($2.75/gallon). Bottled Water ($2/gallon). . Gas at $2.89/gallon is cheap compared to what they pay in Europe, we've got all these other fluids that cost more than gasoline, is gasoline worth so much less to people than these other fluids.	1	3

why does milk cost more than gas per gallon?	Actually, the prices are very reasonable.  Gas in other countries is $5 -$7 per gallon and more. Based on inflation over last 20 years, milk prices are higher than gas prices, so we are lucky it isn't worse.	1	3
why does milk cost more than gas per gallon?	Good question, but you must consider that as gas prices raise, so do Milk prices.  Costs farmers more to feed (transporting food), more to work (gas on farm use) and more to get to a store (gas to the store).  All of that is added in the price of milk in addition to normal costs and things I know I've left out.  So it'll continue to increase as gas does which is why right now it's over the price of gas (actually always has been).	1	4

why does milk cost more than gas per gallon?	That's a good question...	0	1
why does milk cost more than gas per gallon?	Milk costs more, without sales, because of the cost involved in producing packaging, and transporting it. Cows need to be born and raised, given shots and medical care, fed and housed. They produce a limited amount of milk each day. Then the milk gets pasteurized and packaged in individual containers, and has to be transported in a way that keeps it cold the whole time. If it is on the shelf or in transit too long, you won't be able to drink it. Oil on the other hand is already in the ground and is pipelined to a place where it can be pumped into ships, trucks, or barrels. It doesn't need to stay cold and lasts forever. It can be transported without the expense of individual packages. Contrary to what many think today, there are still abundant supplies of it. As the supply decreases, the price will go up to above that of milk. In countries closer to the source, such as Kuwait, gas only costs about 82 cents per gallon, which is less than the cost of water there!	1	4
why does milk cost more than gas per gallon?	Simple answer is that the more rare the thing is it costs more . Milk production is less than gas production.. . The more largescale plant the less is the cost.. Gas plants r like dinosaurs & milk plants r relatively small in size.. . The more middlemans the more is cost.. In the case of Milk collection & distribution there r large number of middle mens r involved than gas distribution system.. . Milk is not having long life & good preservation methods relative to gas, hence weastage of milk is relatively large.. .

why does milk cost more than gas per gallon?	Back when gas was around 20 or 30 cents a gallon, price wars between competing gas stations were common. Some stations started pricing at say 23.9 cents per gallon, which, to the buyer, is psychologically lower than the 24 cents per gallon being charged across the street. The .1 cent difference does not significantly reduce the revenue to the station owner though. Now that prices are above $2.00, it doesn't really make sense anymore, but it is so firmly established that it's hard to go back.	0	2

why some people behave so rude without reason,is it due to their own problem?	For a number of reasons-poor upbringing, just plain rude, but I think the number one reason is that people are just too self centered and self absorbed. Plus most people don't say anything about it, so the rude ones get so used to this behavior they don't realize how big of jerks they are being.Try pointing out their rudeness to them sometimes. I was shopping a few weeks ago and a woman asked me if I knew where a certain section was. I told her then she just walked off! I hollered after her that she was welcome. She hesitated and kind of ducked her head, which I think was caused by her realizing how rude her actions were. It may be wishful thinking, but I don't think so. I have no problem pointing out the rudeness of others to them and most become embarassed because they realize exactly how rude they are being. If more people would be nicer, we could bring back politeness. Kill 'em with kindness!!	1	4

why some people behave so rude without reason,is it due to their own problem?	I understand that little things get overlooked by tired, careless or lazy employees.

Sometimes the rudeness could come from feeling stupid for not knowing the answers; more often, I would suspect that people think that the questions being ask are for the answers rather than help getting to the answers. The reason for homework is to give the student a learning exercise. We take that away when we just hand out answers. If questions were ask in a way that helped the student learn rather than to just give the answer, the people answering may tend to be more tolerable.	1	3
why some people behave so rude without reason,is it due to their own problem?	Some of the problems arise from the student's inability to understand the English language.  Other problems are induced by a cultural dialect that the student refuses to shed.

These name a few; I'm sure there are many more reasons.	0	2

how to make my car faster?	"i build performance cars for a living first of all get rid of the 4"" exhaust not enough back pressure and u loose low end torque and for a four cyclinder horsepower is easy to make its torque thats hard that is why they are not fast. first let me recommend that if u want to go FAST go to ebay type drag car for ur search and watch what comes up it will be nothing but V8 chevy and ford they only true way to go fast. but if ur bent on ur mitsu thats fine but it would help to know ur budget and understand that i can go get a stock 97 or 98 mustang and spend about 1500 bucks and ur car without serious money in it like say around 7 to 8k will never get within 10 car lengths of that mustang. but if u have lets say 1 to 2k to spend here is what u do change ur exhaust to either a 2"" or a 2and a half get ur low end grunt back then put a full length tube header on the car. then if budget still allows call up vex and order there fuel injection nitrous kit for 600 shipped install the kit with a 60 shot or 50 shot nothing more or u can damage the car then order up cam gears so u can retard the timing 2 degrees to compensate for the nitrous then do a tune up run a one stage colder spark plug and get a good set of wires and a good coil make sure ur spark is good then change the fuel filter and the car should run a low 15 high 14 on that. but for that mustang i can change gears from stock 3.27 to 4.1 for 200 in parts order a shift kit or short throw shifter for either an automatic or manual tranny doesnt matter for 200 in parts put that same vex kit in it with a 125 shot tune the motor fuel filter spark plugs wires and order a timing adjuster to compensate the nitrous and the car will run on nitto 555r drag radials in the quater 12.8 et's all day long and ull never get near it. OH i know this because i have built the mustang never did touch the exhaust system prolly could have got the car into 12.50 with exhaust maybe."	1	3

how to make my car faster?	My car is set for 130 mph (Audi A4).  When your car maxes out it will make a pretty bad sounding noise and your RPMs will shoot down and back up.  It's not good for your car, and you shouldn't be going fast enough for the governer to kick in anyway.  Supposing you are at a race track however with a stock car, an ECU chip upgrade can be purchased and programed to override the governer and increas your wheel horsepower and top speed.  This will eventually put a lot of stress on your car so when upgrading the ECU it is normally installed with a new sport exhaust system with cold air intake and possibly big brake upgrades for stopping at higher speeds than the car was meant to.	1	3
how to make my car faster?	I am pleased you have chosen a car that is fast as f##k and not a naff diesel car that when you press the right pedal down all that happens is the engine makes a rattle noise and some black smoke comes out of the exhaust pipe.

how to make my car faster?	It's the way your eyes work.  Your sight isn't really continuous.  Think of it as taking a bunch of pictures really fast, like a strobe light but way faster.  Any way, as a car speeds up, at some point the spokes will appear to be standing still.  At that point they are moving fast enough that your brain is 'taking a picture' each time the wheels make a full rotation.  If they slow down a bit, they will appear to be moving gradually backwards.	0	1

how to make my car faster?	right lane is called the slow lane, because of the ON RAMP AND OFF RAMP of the freeways.  cars that are coming from a on ramp has to match the speed of the freeway cars..

how to make my car faster?	The speedometers tell you how fast you are going. This way, you know by how much you are speeding. The related question raised by another answerer is a great question too: Why does the government permit companies to sell civilians (non racetrack / non emergency services) cars that go faster than is permissible by law ? If it is a crime to drive any faster, then my not rig the cars so you cannot go faster than is legal ?. Apart from medical emergencies and visits to racetracks, the only three answers I can think of is In Case You visit Germany with thei car; in case the law changes to permit speeding; or TO ALLOW THE STATE TO TAX US through giving out these BLEEDING %$£%^&*$£ speeding tickets.. . So overall, it would make more sense to rig cars so you could just floor it and still not be speeding (if this were achievable). . . And similarly, your suggestion that we also rig the speedometers on future cars to go no higher than the maximum legal speed on motorways is also a good one - this way boy racers might be put off and forgetful people would know for sure when they are going too fast.	0	2
how to make my car faster?	"Advances in technology allow us to move at greater speeds.  Although the freeway has a speed limit.  It is not for the car safety, it is for the passengers.  Faster cars offer better acceleration, response, and overall better driving enjoyment.  A car limited to 75, is just not utilizing the potential of efficient transportation.  It's also marketting and sellability.  As with most things in life, most people like power, better, faster, bigger, super, etc.  Unfortunately, we cannot change peoples behavior, and if you limit it to 75.  Many motorists will find ways to ""modify"" the cars to go faster.  Imagine a police car running after a criminal at 75 mph..."	0	2
how to make my car faster?	Planes travel at a faster speed and usually take a more direct path to their destination.  Trains often make stops to load and unload passengers.  Also because they travel on the ground, trains have to weave through mountains.  Tracks sometimes have to work around established neighborhoods or roads.

How do i know if my gold fish is pregnant?	Actually both are Chinese carps belong to the family Cyprinidae one of the largest family of fresh water fishes, All the barbs, puntius are from this group. I do agree that often there will be some confusion to identfy the Koi and Gold fish. Though they belong to different genera. there are reports having cross bread individuals. It is very difficult to identify especially in the young age. One striking difference is almost all gold fish scales are very shiny and koi may be colourful but not so shiny. The second important feature is Koi will grow very fast but gold fish comparatively low. The caudal fin of Koi always will be simple but gold fish mostly it is fan like. When you are selecting very small fishes, this can be easily noticed.If you need only gold fish select those have fan type caudal fin. Koi colour patches are not soo unique and attractive like gold fish but except the variety calico most of the gold fishes have definite and attractive patterns.Koi is ideal only for garden pools but gold fish can be from small indoor tanks to garden pools. Koi's basic stucture is very similar to Common carp and doenot have a pot belly similar to gold fish, Koi is more or less spindle shape with longer body than caudal fin but gold fish especially if they are young, caudal fin length is equal to the body length except in one or two cases. Gold fish body width wlll come down immediately after the stomach and form tail. But koi posterior part slowly narrow down to have a caudal peduncle to form a simple tail. I hope it may be clear now.	0	1

Why do people drink Cuervo when it tastes the same going down as coming up?	That's actually four questions, and I'll go throught them one by one.. . Why do people enjoy alchohol/beer?.      It affects their brains.  While alcohol is a depressant, what it first affects is their inhibitions; people are more likely to perform acts that they may not usually do - like many people have mentioned, attempt a sexual encounter, or perform daredevil-type stunts.. . It taste bitter, why do people like to drink?.     Not all alcohols taste bitter - ice wine, for example, tastes almost syropy, and the alcohol taste is non-existant.  Beers are bitter because of the hops, a bitter vegetable part (I forget if it's a flower or some other part).  Alcohol is very disagreeable (to me), but it's usually the other flavours that make it worthwhile.. . Are they just showing off?.      Not at first.... see answer one for details.. . Or do they truely enjoy it?.      I like the taste of the alcoholic beverages, like beers, scotches, and whiskeys.  Some people will put up with the taste just to get to the 'drunken' state.  I have never understood why blacking out is so much fun, especially if you cannot remember it, but there are people like that, and in North America, that is their right.	0	2

how good is apple pie when it is cold?	I avoid the problem by par-cooking the Apples. Cook your filling over medium heat until 130 degrees F. is reached in an uncovered pot and hold the temperature for 10 minutes. Cool and then add to your pie shell. The apples shrink in the pot,  you also concentrate the flavor since you cooked off some water and the pectin in the Apples will then gel in the baking to give nice firm yet tender Apples without all the juices bleeding out (and the bottom crust doesn't get as soggy).	0	2

Why do Arabs and Mexicans look alike?	I am not Dominican or Mexican, but here is my best guess: In general Mexicans are at a lower socioeconomic status than Dominicans. Since the average Caucasian American can't tell the difference between Dominicans and Mexicans (like the way some people say all Asians look alike), Dominicans are often mistaken for Mexicans, and feel that they are treated with less respect because people assume they are Mexican and poor.. . P.S. Not my belief, I believe people should be treated as INDIVIDUALS, not as Dominican, Mexican, Asian, Caucasian, rich or poor, but this is our society...	1	4

Why can't teenagers vote?	They really should bring that age down to 16. Nowadays teens are more aware of issues, and can even drive a car, and quit school by that age. So, make them responsible to vote.	0	2
Why can't teenagers vote?	they think we are dummies and with that photo of yours, you kind of prove it. okay now i am being mean. so let me give you another explanation. see,if we could vote,then they have to increase the drinking age but adults are greedy so they don't want to share and since we call them greedy they call us dummies and they don't share anything with us.. someone is mean and ugly and i know it is not me.(just kidding)	0	2

Why can't teenagers vote?	i think that teens can vote after 18. as 18 & 19 comes in teen.	1	3
Why can't teenagers vote?	uhhhh.....they can.  The Constitution states that any American citizen can vote when they turn 18.  EightTEEN and nineTEEN year olds can vote.	1	3
Why can't teenagers vote?	Teens can vote at 18&19, but otherwise most teenagers don't realize how important the election is. You see, most candidate discuss topics that we as young teenagers really don't understand or even care about. For instance, when a candidate is currently in office and is running again, typically they will claim to lower taxes but how would we, as teens, know if he went through with this?? We wouldn't because we don't have to pay the bills. At the age of 18 a teen is typically in college and so they are paying their own taxes so they know whether or not the candidate did indeed go through with the tax cut.	1	4
Why can't teenagers vote?	Beacause everyone can vote not just the ones over 18 and they can vote multiple times.	0	2
Why can't teenagers vote?	The teenagers can get jobs and help out.	0	1

Why can't teenagers vote?	WE????? I didn`t vote for him the first or second time or his DAD either and I certainly will NOT vote for his brother JEB Bush..	0	1
Why can't teenagers vote?	their lack of desire/ability to find and decifer the non-parisan truth.	1	4
Why can't teenagers vote?	Teens can vote. When they're 18 and 19. . . Teens still have ALOT to learn. There is nothing wrong or demeaning about this. Even most ADULTS have alot to learn about politics. They go into a voting booth having no idea what party stands for what, or what candidate believes in what, and vote Democrat when their beliefs are Republican, or vote Republican when their beliefs are Democrat.	1	4
Why can't teenagers vote?	In elections?  Because it's a widely held opinion that their brains are not yet developed fully.  (No, I'm not kidding, and please don't take offense.)	0	2
Why can't teenagers vote?	I agree with debidel, the voting age should be raised.. Maybe then we would appreciate it enough to look at all sides of an issue before choosing. . I also think participation would go up to 99.9%.	0	2
Why can't teenagers vote?	They can vote: 18, 19.	1	4
Why can't teenagers vote?	Because they are teenagers. Teenagers do what teenagers do. If they dont do it they are not teenagers	0	2
Why can't teenagers vote?	It's is a right, responsibility, and a privilege reserved for legal adults only at this time.  Some high schools hold a mock election though.  You could suggest having one to someone at your school office.	1	4
Why can't teenagers vote?	at 18 you can, but you'll be suprised just how much real world knowledge you'll gain between 17-25! I do think if any one enlists in the military they should be allowed to drink and vote	1	3
Why can't teenagers vote?	18 and 19 year old teens can vote... however I do not think they should be allowed until age 21 (like drinking), with the stipulation that they could vote at age 18+ if and only if they are active duty military..... . IMHO teens do not have the judgement skills or wisdom to vote... as experienced too much on here when teens participate in the political questions	1	4
Why can't teenagers vote?	well they can but only on a few things :(	0	2
Why can't teenagers vote?	the age to vote is 18 and teens are not 18 yet	0	2
Why can't teenagers vote?	The reason is because to vote is an adult decision and until your 18 your legally not an adult. However I do think that the voting age should be 16 rather than 18. Many people start their first real jobs at around 16 and that means they are paying income taxes. If 16 year olds can be considered adult enough to pay income tax than I think they should be allowed to vote.	1	4
Why can't teenagers vote?	BECAUSE THEY'RE TOO YOUNG (GENERALLY SPEAKING) AND NOT SLY ENOUGH TO UNDERSTAND POLITICS, BUT ALSO BECAUSE THEY'RE TOO BUSY COPING WITH THEIR OWN DEVELOPEMENT AS AN INDIVIDUAL TO GIVE MUCH ATTENTION TO WIDER PERSPECTIVES AND ISSUES..P.S. QUEEN...HELLO!!! THAT WOULD BE EIGHT    TEEN!!!!	1	3
Why can't teenagers vote?	because they don't work, they don't pay taxes, they live with their parents and are not considered mature enough to form their own opinion..... . by the way judging from what adults have voted recently i say give voting rights to animals too, they tend to have better instincts and see through the BS.	1	4
Why can't teenagers vote?	If a person pays taxes they should have the right to vote.. . On the other hand, a person that pays NO tax should not have the right to vote.. . To vote a person should be required to show up with their last pay stub along with a a picture ID. . . Sure would change things.	0	2
Why can't teenagers vote?	Because they don't know enough about life to make proper decisions on who should run the country.  I think you should be 21 to vote like it used to be...I think even 18 is too young.	0	2
Why can't teenagers vote?	When the founding fathers began drawing up the country, they wanted to formulate a republic more than a democracy. In a democracy, as in the time of ancient Greece, everyone had a say and could stand up and speak for themselves during large meetings. In an entire country, rather than just a city state, this idea is impossible and impractical. Therefore they developed a system of people voting in order say who they wanted to represent their best intrests. The founding fathers, though, where white protestant males of upper and middle class status, and thus feared the what they considered to be the uneducated and uninformed masses. That is why they developed the electoral college, so that even if a candiate won the popular vote, they would not necessarily become president. If the founding fathers feared the views of adults of their own time, they would certainly not have approved of the views of their youth, or today's youth for that matter. That is why teenagers cannot vote.	1	3
Why can't teenagers vote?	I guess the initial thinking was teenagers arent rational and cant be trusted on choosing our nations leaders.  Its up to you if you believe that or not.	1	3
Why can't teenagers vote?	They can, but only if they're over eighteen.. The reason for that is that most people under the age of eighteen AREN'T responsible enough OR informed enough to be trusted with such a responsibility.. Personally, I don't think a person should be able to vote at eighteen, or even 21.  I think thirty would be a good age....even if it does mean that I'd have to wait five more years to vote!	1	3

Why can't teenagers vote?	Bandying all teenagers into a group that only buys tat is a bit silly really.. . Yes, a lot of teenagers like what I would consider to be crap music. Good on them. I liked crap music when I was a teenager too. When you're a teenager you don't necessarily want to sit there listening to the deep meaning within music. You want to jump up and down and listen to music that gives you a buzz.. . So let them buy what they like. I pay no attention to the charts anymore anyway and just buy what I like. My daughter listens to crap but I have a louder stereo than her so I can drown it out.. . Crap like Robbie Williams/Westlife is brought by more people over 30 than by teenagers as well... consider that mate....	0	1
Why can't teenagers vote?	Because WE used to be teenagers !!!!    duh	0	2
Why can't teenagers vote?	I don't think all people think teenagers are bad. I certainly don't. I know lots of teenagers that are great!  Teenagers are going through a tough time, and they tend to be rebellious. But that is a part of growing into an adult.	0	2
Why can't teenagers vote?	Because we don't vote. With less than 50% of the voting public actually voting anymore, how are they supposed to know what is right and wrong? If we all go out and vote, and pay attention to what they do, we can take back the country and make it what we want.	0	2
Why can't teenagers vote?	Well, as a teenager myself I can answer this.  The reason why I think teenagers run away from home is they feel trapped and cornered they feel like theres no way out other then to run away and leave the situation behind.	0	1
Why can't teenagers vote?	Short of locking teenagers in individual cells for the entirety of their teenage years?. . There is absolutely nothing that can be done. Just accept it.	0	1
Why can't teenagers vote?	Step into the mind of a teenager. What would they care about? What problems would they face? What feelings would they have? That way a teenager can empathise and associate more with the book, making it seem more interesting and realistic to them.	1	3
Why can't teenagers vote?	are you a dancer?. if your seriously that weight, than your not gonna ever have your period.. you need to eat a lot, like normal teenagers do, and then you'll have your period, like normal teenagers...and weigh like normal teenagers!. . its pretty simple, eat.	0	1
Why can't teenagers vote?	I like teenagers. I think they're funny and cute; fun to watch. But, you're right, only the bad ones make the news. And, they can be a trial at times, as they try to assert their independence and as their hormones surge. Nothing worse than a pack of teenagers with cell-phones on the train! But adults should remember: We were all teenagers once!!	0	2
Why can't teenagers vote?	I would geuss, being a fellow teenager, is that it really is only the bad ones who make the news.  I would also venture to geuss that the good ones have some flaw, and since most other teenagers are bad, the flaws are emphasized, and the teenager's good parts aren't being brought to attention.	0	2
Why can't teenagers vote?	some teenagers just want freedom, or to be independent.. it kinda really depends on the teenager... one of my friends ran away because of abuse...	0	2
Why did the Bush Admin cover up 9/11?	They did not want to admit that George was asleep at the wheel for most of his presidency and his lack of vigillance made this adminsitration look bad.  God knows they had enough warnings.	1	4

Why did the Bush Admin cover up 9/11?	It is amazing how many loons come out when this subject is brought up.	0	2
Why did the Bush Admin cover up 9/11?	Bush was responsible for 9/11.  So, of course he didn't want the military to respond so quickly.	0	2
Why did the Bush Admin cover up 9/11?	Because people keep advancing the half truths that were posted in the second response...Bush didn't cause many of the economic problems after 9/11...it was 9/11.  Some of the policies Bush inacted, including tax cuts are actually making the economy boom today.	1	3
Why did the Bush Admin cover up 9/11?	Those 9-11 widows, and I do feel sorry for them, were a carefully selected panel of democrats  to bash George Bush and blame him for 9-11. The so called 9-11 commission was a Democratic party ploy to attack bush. It is pitiful that anyone lost relatives on 9-11. But their political views just happen to coincide with the democratic party line because the democrats and news media made sure that only democratic 9-11 relatives were selected to speak.  I pitty their loss. But the 9-11 relatives are simply political instruments of democrats and leftists and at this point their views should be ignored.	0	2

Why did the Bush Admin cover up 9/11?	What proof do you have other than reading the 9/11 conspiracy theory's..which cannot prove any thing...	0	2
Why did the Bush Admin cover up 9/11?	because when 9/11 occured, Bush and his entourage were sitting in an elementary school reading a picture book to little children. once he found out, he still sat there for another 20 minutes, continued reading, ignoring the urgent call of the united states emergency. if you would like to here more about it, rent the excellently acclaimed Farenheit 9/11 by Michael Moore. . . Yes, I am a democrat against Bush, but that does not really sway my vote. What bush did on 9/11 was against morals and ethics, ignorning the cries for help.	0	2
Why did the Bush Admin cover up 9/11?	and yet another conspiracy theory nutjob?????sheeeesh!	0	2
Why did the Bush Admin cover up 9/11?	"That governments have permitted terrorist acts against their own people, and have even themselves been perpetrators in order to find strategic advantage is quite likely true, but this is the United States we're talking about.. . That intelligence agencies, financiers, terrorists and narco-criminals have a long history together is well established, but the Nugan Hand Bank, BCCI, Banco Ambrosiano, the P2 Lodge, the CIA/Mafia anti-Castro/Kennedy alliance, Iran/Contra and the rest were a long time ago, so there’s no need to rehash all that. That was then, this is now!. . That Jonathan Bush’s Riggs Bank has been found guilty of laundering terrorist funds and fined a US-record $25 million must embarrass his nephew George, but it's still no justification for leaping to paranoid conclusions.. . That George Bush's brother Marvin sat on the board of the Kuwaiti-owned company which provided electronic security to the World Trade Centre, Dulles Airport and United Airlines means nothing more than you must admit those Bush boys have done alright for themselves.. . That George Bush found success as a businessman only after the investment of Osama’s brother Salem and reputed al Qaeda financier Khalid bin Mahfouz is just one of those things - one of those crazy things.. . That Osama bin Laden is known to have been an asset of US foreign policy in no way implies he still is.. . That al Qaeda was active in the Balkan conflict, fighting on the same side as the US as recently as 1999, while the US protected its cells, is merely one of history's little aberrations.. . The claims of Michael Springman, State Department veteran of the Jeddah visa bureau, that the CIA ran the office and issued visas to al Qaeda members so they could receive training in the United States, sound like the sour grapes of someone who was fired for making such wild accusations.. . That one of George Bush's first acts as President, in January 2001, was to end the two-year deployment of attack submarines which were positioned within striking distance of al Qaeda's Afghanistan camps, even as the group's guilt for the Cole bombing was established, proves that a transition from one administration to the next is never an easy task.. . That so many influential figures in and close to the Bush White House had expressed, just a year before the attacks, the need for a ""new Pearl Harbor"" before their militarist ambitions could be fulfilled, demonstrates nothing more than the accidental virtue of being in the right place at the right time.. . That the company PTECH, founded by a Saudi financier placed on America’s Terrorist Watch List in October 2001, had access to the FAA’s entire computer system for two years before the 9/11 attack, means he must not have been such a threat after all.. . That whistleblower Indira Singh was told to keep her mouth shut and forget what she learned when she took her concerns about PTECH to her employers and federal authorities, suggests she lacked the big picture. And that the Chief Auditor for JP Morgan Chase told Singh repeatedly, as she answered questions about who supplied her with what information, that ""that person should be killed,"" suggests he should take an anger management seminar.. . That on May 8, 2001, Dick Cheney took upon himself the job of co-ordinating a response to domestic terror attacks even as he was crafting the administration’s energy policy which bore implications for America's military, circumventing the established infrastructure and ignoring the recommendations of the Hart-Rudman report, merely shows the VP to be someone who finds it hard to delegate.. . That the standing order which covered the shooting down of hijacked aircraft was altered on June 1, 2001, taking discretion away from field commanders and placing it solely in the hands of the Secretary of Defense, is simply poor planning and unfortunate timing. Fortunately the error has been corrected, as the order"	1	3
Why did the Bush Admin cover up 9/11?	Oh, come on! Don't you know it has been debunked over and over again. There is also a million dollar reward for any body who can prove it. Once more ppl are swayed by Media (Internet) with no proof. You ppl watch TV too much.	0	2
Why did the Bush Admin cover up 9/11?	what part was covered up. we have seen thousands of videos, there are countless websites, and more conspiracy theories than if Elvis killed JFK. what about the even was covered up? remember, thousands of people died that day, and there are thousands of families with out a parent/child. you are disrespecting the memories of the victims, you are disrespecting the families of the victims. you need to let this go. there was a conspiracy on 9/11. it was between the 20 or so hijackers and bin laden.	1	3
Why did the Bush Admin cover up 9/11?	I've not heard that there was a cover up.  But I'm sure Bush haters came up with that one.  Let's face it, Clinton is to blame for 911m after all he had 8 years to take out OBL which is when the 911 planning was being done.  Bush inherited a mess from ole Bill, slow economy, a military in ruin, and lost respect for the oval office.. Bush has made his mistakes also, but we have record low unemployment, more new home owners, and a military that loves their commander in chief. (I live in a military town)	1	3

Why did the Bush Admin cover up 9/11?	OK, I am not a Bush fan. But regarding this conspiracy theory...Its bogus. Just stop and think. has Bush been able to successfully cover up anything since he got into office? Come on, now, be honest. Every time Bush has tried to lie to the American people he got caught early on. Every time. He is as adept as a drunken man stumbling across an icy street. For Bush to undertake a cover up of the magnitude you suggest and not get caught right away...impossible my friend. his dirty fingerprints would be all over it like the doorknob of a bus station restroom.	0	2
Why did the Bush Admin cover up 9/11?	because if the truth came out they would be out of office and into prison!	1	3
Why did the Bush Admin cover up 9/11?	I do not think they think they did anything wrong.  They are in a position of such power that they think they are infallible and to this day they relish that power.

Why did the Bush Admin cover up 9/11?	Duh... Cause man,  No-one could see that the planes were flying into the buildings, so no-one would blame the Taliban for it.  They knew that stupid people who hate our country would come up with a ridiculous theory like the one you are suggesting....duh	1	3

Why did the Bush Admin cover up 9/11?	"Bush did not plan 9/11. An attack of that magnitude requires careful planning over many years, and he just doesn't plan that well. Look at the spectacle that Iraq has become.. . Bush opposed the 9/11 commission because he didn't want anyone ""second-guessing"" him. That's just how he is - stubborn ,arrogant, and ""holier-than-thou""."	1	3
Why did the Bush Admin cover up 9/11?	because bush planned 9/11	0	2
Why did the Bush Admin cover up 9/11?	"rg brooks19 has a great answer. This war was started by Bush because he lost face big time after 9/11. He failed to find bin Laden, he failed to avenge all those who died, and he failed to live up to his promises he made standing at ground zero. Bush made the mistake of thinking this would be a quick and painless war, one that would look good on the evening news, and increase his popularity rating. I personally believe Bush should be impeached for starting this war. He lied to Congress, and he lied to us. If you want some good reading, go to www.thelibertyclub.com, scroll down to the ""Learn the Truth"" icon, and read what they have about 9/11. These are scary times we live in people."	0	2
Why did the Bush Admin cover up 9/11?	All media is a lie!  Everything we see is a lie!  Propaganda to the max.  You think Usama Bin Laden actually planned 9/11?  We're all too stupid to know that Bush paid him a large sum of money!  Everything's an act!  That was my example.	0	2

Why did the Bush Admin cover up 9/11?	"They keep repeating lies because that's all they have. If a lie is repeated often enough, people start to believe it. Both sides of the aisle lie equally well. I never heard a democrat say Saddam was responsible for 9/11, though. Bob Woodward, in ""Bush at War"" says ""Iraq, along with Al Qaeda, was most probably involved in the September 11 attacks, and President Bush understands that. Already on September 17, six days later, Mr. Bush affirmed, ""I believe Iraq was involved, but I'm not going to strike them now."" Scott McClellan, right before the Iraq invasion, said "" ""Listen, we're going to war because President Bush believes Saddam Hussein was involved in 9/11. Al Qaeda is a front for Iraqi intelligence.""  . . . I agree with your point. Iraqis didn't attack us until we attacked them. Don't sovereign nations have the right to defend themselves? If we had put as much effort into Afghanistan as we are putting into Iraq, bin Laden, who actually DID attack us, never would have made it out of Tora Bora."	1	3
Why did the Bush Admin cover up 9/11?	Answer: He's not a hero.  He's a pawn.  . The fact that Rep's are bandying around his name (his political experience is as a mayor, for crying out loud!) as a possible presidential candidate just shows how desperate they are, and how knee-jerk-emotional-patriotic we're all supposed to get at the mention of 9-11.  . Giuliani allowed one of the biggest cover-ups of evidence ever at the site of the twin towers.  We all know something doesn't add up around the 9-11 story...	0	2
Why did the Bush Admin cover up 9/11?	Guelph war - Bush senior . +. Iraq war - Bush Jr. = OIL. I agree this war is not about 9/11 I agree this is an act of terrorism on Bush's part he and his family made the majority of their money from oil.. . If this war was about 9/11 they would have caught Bin Laden along time ago. But due to the fact the Bin Laden's and the Bush's have been in business for years.. . Read the book called Conspiracy	1	3
Why did the Bush Admin cover up 9/11?	For the most part, it was phenomenal. The dot com stocks went crazy (although they took a major tumble). He had nothing to do with it though. It was good timing on his part. At the end of his administration; however, it started to go down and then Bush began... then 9-11 really hurt everything.	0	2
Why did the Bush Admin cover up 9/11?	"Good luck, because they will hide behind 9/11 and new security measures...they will call you ""unpatriotic"" or a ""Potential terrorist"" to cover their intrusive, rude, attacks.. . Be glad that places are being that thorough, because maybe those actions will help prevent the next hi-jacking."	0	2
Why did the Bush Admin cover up 9/11?	The current US President, George Bush, maintains friendly relationships with Saudi Arabian princes and so does his Father, the Former President Bush.  These friendships go back many years.  I think they have mutual interests in Oil and the USA has Military Bases in Saudi Arabia.. Perhaps they talk about why the 9/11 terrorists all came from Saudi Arabia?	1	4
Why did the Bush Admin cover up 9/11?	Do U remember 9/11. I do and I don't like Bush. I would not vote for him ever!!!! He was fully aware of 9/11 before it ever happened. He didn't care.   Our children are over seas not to fight a war. But, to induldge Bush. After all that war could have been over in a matter of weeks if Bush wasn't holding them back..   He doesn't want to win this war because he has to much invested in the oil companys.	0	2
Why did the Bush Admin cover up 9/11?	Apparently Bush was thinking that there were Weapons of Mass Destruction over in Iraq and they were pointed at him, so he saw fit to send our service men and women over there to die over a bit of misinformation.  9/11 had to do with Afganistan.	1	4
Why did the Bush Admin cover up 9/11?	9/11 wasnt a terrorist attack, it was a controlled demolition executed with military precision used as an excuse to go into afghanastan, in turn heading to Iraq to finish the job that George H W Bush started. Not to mention its a damn good place for a forward military base. Open you eyes America.	1	3
Why did the Bush Admin cover up 9/11?	Because his regime was THE ones that set it all up in the 1st place..he didnt know about it tho till after the attacks took place...but Cheney sure did know....as did Daddy Bush and his ol CIA cronies..theyve been bizzy in the Middle East for decades... . It was not for nothing that all the hijackers were Saudies...as Bush and his friendships to the house of Saude will attest to. . This current government isnt any Americans friend..it is only in this for what they themselves can get out of it. . and 9-11 did save a failed Presidency...didnt it? But not for long.	0	2
Why did the Bush Admin cover up 9/11?	Yeah, I think the only people who are using 9/11 as an excuse for this war are the Bush Administration.  Pretty much everyone else knows why we are in Iraq.  amazing, isn't it.	0	2
Why did the Bush Admin cover up 9/11?	Because the people controlling Bush, are the ones behind 9-11, are the ones who control the news/media. Check out who actually owned the World Trade Center, who took out a 99 years lease worth billions, who got the whole complex insured specificaly for terrorist attacks 6 WEEKS before 9-11 and he's not the only one to gain from those attacks. Check it out !	1	3
Why did the Bush Admin cover up 9/11?	I agree with you. Below site explains how they are really going against what Jesus taught. Also it covers why they are really doing it and it has nothing to do with religion. The reason for this is the same one for 9/11/01-- religious intolerance.	0	2

Remove the giblets, rinse in and out.  Sprinkle entire chicken, inside and out, with seasonging:  Cajun (my favorite), lemon pepper, season salt, etc.  Open a can of beverage:  beer, orange pop, root beer--anything.  Slip the chicken over the can, and place on the grill.  Grill at medium heat (around 350 degrees on my grill) about 90 minutes.  Don't peek!  To prevent flare ups and the grill lid touching your bird, put a little foil under and over the chicken.  I've not tried it, but I hear this works well in the oven, too.	0	2

how do i find out if someone left me a life insurance policy?	First we should define insurance for you.  Insurance is a product AND a service you purchase to protect your assets, things you may own, or have a financial interest in.  A few examples are your auto, life, home, and/or business.  . A liability is an expense you owe someone/something or may owe someone/something else in the future.. When you purchase this very important coverage on any insurance policy you are protecting yourself against a future expense that may occur.. Each asset mentioned above has different types of liability coverages, that protect you from having to pay large or small amounts out of your pocket.. Your insurance agent should be knowledgeable and a person you trust, someone you see as a financial counselor.  The next time your policy renews or if you are purchasing a policy for the first time make sure to discuss if the coverages are ADEQUETE for you and your family.	1	3

In the atmosphere, the rising air is called a 'Thermal' which is used by gliders, hang-gliders and soaring birds to get the lift.. . This principle is also used in domestic heating where the convection currents circulate the warm air around a room.. . (Convection currents are also set up in liquids)	1	4

Why hot air rises up?	the hot air drives them upward, since the hot air occupies more space than cold air it is much less dense. (hot air rises)	1	4
Why hot air rises up?	Hot air rises, cold air sinks.	0	2
Why hot air rises up?	Hot air rises.  Colder air moves rapidly (making wind) in order to fill in the void that hotter air left behind when it rises up.	1	3
Why hot air rises up?	"PV=nRT. . as temperature rises - for a constant number of molecules and a constant pressure - the volume increases. A larger volume for the same number of molecules means lower density. Thus a pocket of hot air ""floats"" in the cold air - or rises up."	1	4
Why hot air rises up?	"It doesn't! . . As my old Physics teacher used to say (usually just after throwing something at us!).... . ""Hot air rises *above cooler air*"". . As has been said, it is because less dense gasses will rise above more dense gasses. So, since warm air is less dense than cold air it will rise above it until it finds air of the same density, at which point it stops rising."	1	4
Why hot air rises up?	When air is hot, the heat energy causes the molecules to move further apart and so the density of hot air is lower than that of colder air. the lower density results in it rising up.	1	4
Why hot air rises up?	Well, let us think of a balloon, as our system.. he gas inside it has a random movement and. is less dense than the air outside our balloon.. . Let it free to move. The balloon flows upward. Why ??. . Well, as you know, the gravity force, acting downward,. results in a force from the bottom to the top, and the. balloon goes up !!  Over the superior face of the balloon. you have a great mass of air, acting upon it. But,. against it, under the inferior face of the balloon there. will act a bigger mass of air, that weights more. The. difference in weights results in a force upward.. And the balloon goes up.. . If there were no gravity force, there will be no forces. acting upon the balloon.. . The same happens with our hotter air surrounded. by the colder air. The random movement of the hotter. air - considered as a system - has no effect upon the. resulting force. And the colder air flows down, to the. place where the hotter air was before ( otherwise. a vacuum will be produced...what impels the colder. air to flow and fill that empty place ). I did not mention. here the action of winds or other atmospheric phenomena. just to make things easier.	1	3
Why hot air rises up?	Hot air rises cold air descends.  Do it on a global scale and you get wind.	0	2
Why hot air rises up?	cos can u imagine what would happen if it didnt	0	2
Why hot air rises up?	as cold particles are heavier then hot ones (more CO2)	1	4
Why hot air rises up?	Because the molecules are further apart, so they need more room.	1	4
Why hot air rises up?	We contribute by talking to much causing hot air to rise up and warm the atmosphere.	0	2
Why hot air rises up?	Heat rises and flames are very hot.. Heat makes the air less dense (lighter) and so the cooler, heavier air sinks. . Notice that the smoke cools as it gets away from the flame and spreads out after a point. It is because it mixes with the colder, heavier air and quits rising.	1	3
Why hot air rises up?	Let's keep it simple; hot air rises, and cold air sinks. Hence, you have the cold air released near the ceiling, and it flows down through the room, and the warm air released near the floor to flow up into the room. It's for a more even dispersement of the 'conditioned' air.	1	3
Why hot air rises up?	Because hot air holds more water.  Hot air also seeks to rise, which pushes down cold air.  As it mingles with the cold air, it loses some of its heat.  When the air reaches a cool enough temperature for the amount of water it has in it - it rains.	1	3
Why hot air rises up?	It's because when air gets hot it expands, and when it gets cold it contracts.  The cold air coming from the air conditioner is denser than the air that's already in the house, so it tends to sink.  If the AC vent were in the floor, the air higher up would never get cold, but with the vent in the ceiling, the cold air falls through the room and cools everything.  In the same manner, hot air rises, so having the vents in the floor makes the hot air float through the room instead of just staying on the ceiling and leaving the floor cold.	1	4
Why hot air rises up?	Hi.  A mushroom cloud forms over any hot explosion. It is just the hot gas rising up. It is hotter in the middle so the middle rises a bit faster, drawing in the air around it. Here is an explanation : http://www.answers.com/main/ntquery?s=mushroom%20cloud&gwp=16	0	2
Why hot air rises up?	"""Hot air rises"". Also, heated water causes water-vapor to rise from the surface of the water, forming clouds above, and winds circulating around the water vapor. Almost all (or all) hurricanes are formed by water vapor rising from the heated seas and oceans."	1	4
Why hot air rises up?	This has to do with air densities and at different temperatures you have different densities. Just so happens that for every form of matter, colder means heavier which means more density. . . If cold air is denser then it weighs more given the same volume of hot air. So in weighing more, the cold air will fall rather than rise. . . So in making a freezer with the freezing compartment at the top is just a form of efficiency. The motor has to do less work in disposing of the cold air. When it is released gravity does the rest of the job and pulls it downwards while the warmer air rises.. . That's why at super markets freezers look like pools because they keep cold air in which does not rise but keeps hot air out which would not settle down low.	1	4
Why hot air rises up?	Heat causes air to expand inside the ball, the skin is more taut creating a better bounce.  It is the same concept as a hot air ballon, the heat expands the air and the ballon rises	0	2
Why hot air rises up?	The balloon is filled with hot air by the burner.  The hot air inside the balloon rises because it is lighter than cold (or cooler air).  assuming you mean't a hot air balloon.. . Nobody is sure about helium ballons because we always suck the helium out so we can talk weird.	1	3
Why hot air rises up?	1) You spelled safety wrong. 2) It depends if you want to get out of the burning building. 3) Assuming you want to live, stay low because hot air (including smoke) rises. Which means if you want to see and breathe efficiently, stay low.	0	2

How do I remove the SIMM card on a LG VX8300 Cell Phone?	Congrats...nice phone.. . I have a Virgin Mobile Slider Sonic, and I plug my USB cable into the computer and just drag what i want to it. Mind you, that you are using a transflash or a Micro SD card, you can put whatever you want on the card, it might not (or in most cases, will not) show up on the phone.... . Your phone comes with a USB cable that hooks to your phone. while it's hooked up, your phone is off and in file transfer mode. Most likely, you need to be running Windows XP on your comp to use it, but once you get the hang of it, you'll be able to do cool things with it. (I think you can send people songs from your phone, but read the manual to be sure!). . By the way, be careful with your card, and try not to remove it from the phone too much if you don't need to. If you have to transfer it to a card reader, be careful, because Micro SD cards are VERY sensitive.. . Enjoy, and I hope this helps alittle.	0	2

There exists a unique connection between art and civil society in our American democracy. We are a nation of nations, deeply dependent upon the ability of our citizens to communicate across lines denoting difference -- difference in religion, race, ethnicity, nationality, gender, language.. . Since the late nineteenth century, American music has evolved as an expression of the social climate and environment of the times. Throughout its modern history, this expression has diverged into various styles attracting its disciples of music taste. Some expressions, like traditional jazz, Dixieland, big band swing, disco, and others stagnated, refusing to evolve, becoming footnotes and addendums of this rich history. Today, the adherents of this music reveal its beauties with anachronistic fervor. Some expressions, like jazz, the Blues, Latin, and others, continue to evolve into refined stages and altered states. Its music re-emerging with each generation in creative and unique combinations. But nowhere, to this point, has the message been more important than the medium that sends it.

Why is religious freedom more important today?	my opinion it has always been important.  Today we have a war that is being depicted as based on religion so it is important from the stand point that it would be illegal to round up all the Muslims like they did to the Japanese Americans in WW2.. . For Christians I believe it is not good to live where there is religious freedom. I was in Europe during the cold war.  In hungary we had misionaries.  The people there who were christians were like only a few Christians are here today.  They would not have met secretly and had the extremely high moral and oneness were it legal.  There you only became a Christian because you loved God and Jesus,  because doing so was life threatening.   Nobody became a christian to make their business more profitable or because their friends went to church.   Persecution is good for the church so encourage all those atheists.	1	3

It was Protestants who invented the Idea of Individual Religious Freedom, as opposed to princes or priests determining the content of our minds..

Why is religious freedom more important today?	Because this world is more pluralistic than in generations past and we're aware of that plurality faster due to things like television and the internet. We can see faraway parts of the world and learn about other cultures in the blink of an eye.. . In America, when the country was founded, it was just a handful of colonies who were essentially from the same countries, same race, same religion. They were fleeing religious persecution from their own religions. Now, over two hundred years later, America's much bigger with a lot more people coming here for those same freedoms.. . The right to religious freedom isn't restricted to the Christian religions of our founding fathers. They guaranteed that freedom for everyone, even if they couldn't possibly foresee how far that freedom would reach. There are more people, more nationalities and religions here than ever before, so it's even more important now to safeguard that right.. . If we don't, and we become a theocracy, all but 1% of the nation is going to have to either convert, leave, or risk being arrested or worse.

Why is religious freedom more important today?	DECEPTION !! Satan works through deception..freedom of everything ..freedom is good when purpose is good / godly..otherwise , freedom in a sense against God's will ,it is deception ...a sin ...America leads the world in ensuring freedom of religion ...when the whole world rests in trust , then enforcement of religions occur as in the prophecy of Revelation 13....the enforcement of the 666 is none other but the opposite of religious freedom ..and who leads this time ? America !!! Deception today ? ...God Bless	0	2
Why is religious freedom more important today?	"It is important in today's world because of the vast variety of cultures that now call the USA home. It is important to let people find their own way to enlightenment, without being pressured by the more dominant religions (which happens anyways). And then there is that small little thing we had to go through way back when, that if you disagreed with the ""Church"" you were burned or stoned to death. I think it is important that this does not happen in the US anymore and would like to think that it is because we have matured as a society. You'd think we have grown, but I am skeptical as the same thing happens behind closed doors so that instead of physical harm (most of time because there are always extremists who think they are above the law), mental harm is inflicted. So have we grown, or have we digressed...that is true question behind the supposed freedom of religion declaration."	1	4

Why is religious freedom more important today?	Religious freedom is a misnomer.  Most of the settlements were started so that other religions would not be present to interfere with their own.  They were not usually actively oppressed in Europe, they were simply intolerant of others who did not believe the same way.  Proof:  When they started their American colonies, they were very intolerant of outside beliefs within their colonies (not a characteristic of one who believes in Religious freedom).	0	2

Why do airplanes fly so high?	two reasons:. . 1) better fuel economy. 2) higher airspeed	1	4
Why do airplanes fly so high?	Jet engines are DESIGNED to fly at high altitudes.  They get better economy.  A jet aircraft needs to get altitude as quickly as possible.   And second, the air is less turbulent and therefore a smoother ride.    Pops	1	3
Why do airplanes fly so high?	Number one, the higher you go, the smoother the air is.  It is also because the higher you go, you cover more distance because the arc of assent and descent covers greater distance.  There is less structural stress on an airplane at a higher altitude.  The temperature is very cold, so jet engines perform better and more efficiently.  Finally, the higher you go, the less congested the air space is.	1	4
Why do airplanes fly so high?	less turbluence, smoother, above all the clouds and storms.	1	4
Why do airplanes fly so high?	so people don't look into the windows	0	2
Why do airplanes fly so high?	I think the reason is planes can go faster at high altitudes due to the air been thinner. I think its called the slipstrem	1	3
Why do airplanes fly so high?	At higher altitude the air is thinner and there is less drag on the airframe, the engines also consume vastly less fuel. As the air gets colder the engines run more efficiently until you get to about 36,000 feet where the air stops cooling down. There's also a change over between your ground speed being limited by indicated air speed and mach number. Below that height, somewhere around 28,000 feet, as you climb at constant air speed your ground speed inscrease, above that height as you climb at constant mach number your ground speed decreases... and so does your indicated air speed which ultimately limits your altitude as your indicated air speed at maximum mach number starts to approach your minimum air speed without high lift devices.. . Passanger comfort and avoiding weather are important, but efficiency is king, that's why 747s were capable of M0.92 but more modern jets tend to cruise at M0.8 and max out at M0.875 or below. They can't back off the mach number much without reducing their ability to reach the most effieient cruising altitudes.	1	4
Why do airplanes fly so high?	"The air is much thinner at high altitudes, and the engines on long-range jets are designed to operate at their best efficency in thin air. Also, since the air is so much thinner at high altitude the resistance against the aircraft (drag) is much reduced, meaning they jet burns less fuel for the same effect. This translates into much better fuel economy, leaving more money per mile for the airline. Also, airliners cruise at different altitudes with a minimum 500' of separation. This makes for a lot of different ""lanes"" for them to use, and makes it safer for many planes to be in the air at the same time, reducing the chance of collision."	1	4
Why do airplanes fly so high?	The primary reason is to fly above the weather that would be encountered en route at lower levels. Passenger comfort, safety, separation from other aircraft, & depending on direction of flight, to take advantage of the higher wind speeds that are available at the higher altitudes.	1	4

Why do airplanes fly so high?	That's a guy who flys an airplane.. There is usually a plot and a co-plot.	0	2
Why do airplanes fly so high?	Aircraft need at least 1,000 feet separation to keep them from a risk of collision. Also, at high altitudes, aircraft can avoid bad weather from below (e.g. storms).	1	4
Why do airplanes fly so high?	This is called Bernoulli's Principle whic states that- . .  work done=change in kinetic energy,.  change in pressure*area*distance=change in kinetic energy.   .  this implies .  Pressure+(kinetic energy/volume)=Constant. . Hence when speed of medium is high then it have low pressure and any thing will move from high pressure to low pressure.. . The wings of an airplane is made in the way that pressure above them remains low(due to high speed of air above them in comparision to lower side of wings).due to this an upward thrust get exerted on wings which causes plane to fly in the air..    Bernoulli's principle also explains spining of a cricket ball,perfume spraying etc.	1	4
Why do airplanes fly so high?	Airlines are sending their airplanes to countries with lower labor costs for major work like overhauls.This will drive down the pay of American mechanics who compete with workers who earn one third of our pay.The planes will fly to the country with the lowest labor so the countries doing the work now will get the same treatment when cheaper labor is located.. . You can open a business and hire mechanics to repair small airplanes which is a growing sector,it is easier to avoid taxes as a business than as a worker.Perhaps you can fly the plane across the border to get it repaired then fly back like visiting a dentist for cheaper treatment.. . Education and training is touted as a way to increase pay but other countries can bid your wages down to their level and make your investment worthless.Workers in America elect politicians on cultural issues like abortion but when in office they enact economic deregulation and never get around to the cultural stuff.	0	2

Why do airplanes fly so high?	Airplanes are NOT restricted to flying at altitudes greater than 10,000 meters. Many high-performance military jets routinely fly at altitudes of 13,000 meters and higher. I've flown on commercial jet aircraft at 10,700 meters.. . However, at altitudes greater than about 21,336 meters the air is getting too thin for conventional jet engines to operate.	1	3
Why do airplanes fly so high?	An airplane flies due to the aerodynamic reactions that happen when air passes at high speed over the wing.. . If you look at a cross-section of an airplane wing, you will see that the top of the wing is curved, while the bottom of the wing is straight -- or at least curved less than the top. This shape -- called an airfoil -- is what creates lift when a wing travels through the air.	0	2
Why do airplanes fly so high?	Airplanes fly by creating lower pressure on the top of the wing than on the bottom.  Since the top is curved, air travels over it faster, creating lift.. . Boats float by displacing water.  If the mass of the volume of water displaced is greater than the mass of the boat, it will float.	0	2

Why do airplanes fly so high?	Before we dive into how wings keep airplanes up in the air, it's important that we take a look at four basic aerodynamic forces: lift, weight, thrust and drag. . .  . .  . . . Straight and Level Flight. In order for an airplane to fly straight and level, the following relationships must be true: . . Thrust = Drag . Lift = Weight . If, for any reason, the amount of drag becomes larger than the amount of thrust, the plane will slow down. If the thrust is increased so that it is greater than the drag, the plane will speed up. . Similarly, if the amount of lift drops below the weight of the airplane, the plane will descend. By increasing the lift, the pilot can make the airplane climb. . .  .  Thrust. Thrust is an aerodynamic force that must be created by an airplane in order to overcome the drag (notice that thrust and drag act in opposite directions in the figure above). Airplanes create thrust using propellers, jet engines or rockets. In the figure above, the thrust is being created with a propeller, which acts like a very powerful version of a household fan, pulling air past the blades.	1	4
Why do airplanes fly so high?	The secret of an airplane's flight is the shape of its wing's crossection. I wish I could draw you a diagram, but just think of it a a flat bottom with an upper section sloping down from a high rounded curve to a point at the back of the wing. It creates a vacuum above the wing at high velocities and produces upward lift.. . I hope that helped	0	2
Why do airplanes fly so high?	For piston engine airplane, they use supercharged method or turbo to compress more air to engine.  However, above 10k ft even a turbo and supercharged enginer will not be efficent.  So, piston engine airplane is designed to fly less than 10k ft. . . As far as jet engine, they lose engine power as altitude goes up.  But as higher altitude with less air density, the drag will go down as well.  Therefore less engine power is needed for crusing at high altitude.	1	3

Such a glass may be under pressure always, so that when it breaks, it's going to go everywhere no matter what."	0	1
what factors cause the Earth to heat unevenly?	could be your tires wearing unevenly. too much or too little air presure	0	1
what factors cause the Earth to heat unevenly?	"They just wear out.  The filaments turn to gas when they're hot, and then back to solid when they're off.  The tungsten, halogen, or whatever material the filaments are manufactured with, tend to return to the ""wire"" form, but they form unevenly, causing weak spots that eventually wear out and break, causing the ""burned-out bulb"" condition.  Just replace them and be safe."	0	1
what factors cause the Earth to heat unevenly?	Wind is the roughly horizontal movement of air (as opposed to an air current) caused by uneven heating of the Earth's surface. It occurs at all scales, from local breezes generated by heating of land surfaces and lasting tens of minutes to global winds resulting from solar heating of the Earth. The two major influences on the atmospheric circulation are the differential heating between the equator and the poles, and the rotation of the planet (Coriolis effect).	1	4
what factors cause the Earth to heat unevenly?	One theory is that radioactive decay of the primordial elements inside the Earth, U-238, Th-232, and U-235 and their radioactive products generate thermal energy (heat)and this heat is trapped inside causing the core to be so hot	1	3
what factors cause the Earth to heat unevenly?	the heat at the core of the earth is a remnant of the earths formation  it is theoriuzed that the earth formed from materials ranging in size from small particles like dust to large clumps of materials the size of houses.  When these materials collected into a sphere heat was produced as they impacted for the first few hundred million years the earth was a ball of molten rock.  the crust quickly cooled but the core remains in a molten state. as a side note: mars informed in the same way because it is slightly smaller it lost its heat more quickly and now has a solid core.	0	1
what factors cause the Earth to heat unevenly?	in your microwave standing waves are set up, with nodes (places of 0 vibrational displacement of water molecules) and antinode(places with max vibrational displacement of water molecules), this is also why your microwave rotates so the antinodes are at different positions in the food.. . in a conductor this causes an uneven charge distrubution. Then current flows! causing the shimmering and crackling.	0	1
what factors cause the Earth to heat unevenly?	because of our atmosphere........... the hot gas is lighter than the cool gas........so as the air heats due to he suns radiation is rises up and goes away rom the earth surface........this way the toal heat never reaches the earth surface. Ozone protects from the ultra violet light.......thats not responsible for heat.......its the infra red part thats responsible for heat.	1	4
what factors cause the Earth to heat unevenly?	Skin pigmentation unevenly distributed. The melatonin reacts to sunlight. It is harmless.	0	1
what factors cause the Earth to heat unevenly?	"The Greenhouse effect is somewhat the principle how gases such as CO(sub2) or Carbon Dioxide causes heat to be trapped and unable to escape.. . The greenhouse effect, in turn, causes the heating of the earth called ""global warming"", characterized by increase of global temperatures."	1	4
what factors cause the Earth to heat unevenly?	"It is mainly from residual heat from when the earth first formed & the breakdown of radioactive elements w/in the earth. Pressure from the overlying material can also create heat.. . The earth is actually cooling but it will take a very long time for it to ""completely"" cool."	1	4
what factors cause the Earth to heat unevenly?	The combination of heat and air pressure beneath the earth's surface	1	3
what factors cause the Earth to heat unevenly?	Some gases in the air are better conductors of heat than others. One of the best conductors is Carbon Dioxide CO2. However, it is only present in small amounts in the atmospher <1%. . . A significant amount of heat energy that hits the earth from the sun is radiated back into space. On of the things that affect the amount of heat that is radiated back into space is the composition of that atmospher. Because CO2 is such a good condductor of heat, any increase in the amount in the atmospher traps some of the heat that would have been radiated into space, and increasing the temperature of the planet.. . A long time ago the earth was hot because the atmoshpere had great amounts of CO2. Mother nature slowly found a way to trap that CO2 in the form of fossil fuels deep with in the earth. Today, we burn that fuel and re-release that CO2 back into the atmospher, and cause global warmimg.	1	4
what factors cause the Earth to heat unevenly?	"Absorption of infrared radiation causes a temperature increase in the surface of the item in question.  The heating effect is usually uneven and spreads from the side facing the source of infrared radiation to the opposite side.  Some materials absorb IR more readily than others, hence the so-called ""greenhouse effect"".  The glass of the greenhouse absorbs little of the IR directed at it but the interior heats quite effectively in full sunlight.  Hope that helps."	1	4

how cloning will affects our community?	Cloning involves producing an exact copy of  something ( in a biological sense this includes a cell or an entire organism / tissue). . . cloning occurs constantly in nature, by means of the production of genetically identical organisms via asexual reproduction. For example, in mitosis- 2 identical daughter cells are produced per cell division, binary fission- the method by which bacteria 'clone' themselves.. . We can hi-jack the cell's natural mechanisms to clone an animal/ cell.... . 1. a cell is chosen to be the host cell ( into which we will add DNA). 2.all its genetic material is removed. 3. the genetic material of another particular cell is injected into the first cell. 4. this cell is then stimulated ( electrically/ chemically) to start dividing.. 5. once stimulated the cell can be placed inside a female host and carried to gestation.. . while there seems to be endless possibilities with cloning, the success rates are relatively low.	1	3

As for the reason it 'shines', this is indeed due to the combustion therein emitting radiation in the form of visible light. The sun, due to its immense heat, emits yellow/white light.

How can I keep my rabit indoors?	Potty train her using a cat litter box, but do not use cat litter cuz bunnies eat some of their poop.  Instead use hay or newspaper.  Since you have a girl you don't have to worry about her spraying the walls around the litter box (a problem we had with my boy).  Just continue to put her in the box when she poops and pees.  Also, put some of her poop in the box the first time to help her. Always leave a little of the previous waste in the box when you empty it to help her remember where to go.  We kept ours in the bathroom so we had one litter box.  If you are going to let her hop around the whole house you will need a litter box in almost every room to begin with so that she can become trained.  Also, you want to be careful that cords are tied up out of her way so that she won't chew on them.  Our bunny chewed the baseboard around our bathroom.  You might want to spray it with bitter apple to keep the bunny from chewing on it or other things that are low.  Good luck and have fun.

How can I keep my rabit indoors?	"Actually, there are a lot of considerations to think about when bringing a bunny indoors.  Personally, I think it is a much better environment for them, but you need to understand that they may not immediately take to your surroundings the way you would like.  Firstly, there is the cage training/litter training thing.  Rabbits are naturally neat creatures and therefore are fairly easy to train.  The key is patience.  Also, if your rabbit has not been spayed, you might want to have this done as it will make potty training easier.  My suggestion is to line a cat litter pan with newspaper, then cover that in hay.  This will give the bunny a reason to go into the pan in the first place, as well as something to dig around in to cover up their ""business"" when they are done.  . . Another important thing to consider is chewing.  Because a rabbit's teeth are constantly growing, they chew to keep them ground down.  Make sure your bun has plenty of safe chew toys to play with.  Mine  love cardboard boxes, telephone books, wooden bird toys, and baby teething keys.  One thing to remember is that wires and the like are often found at floor level, making them a convenient place for a bun to chew.  Not only is this bad for your home electronics, it can give your rabbit a nasty shock too!  Your local electronics store should have some good, sturdy cable wraps to tuck away such temptations.  . . You should also think about restricting your rabbit's access to carpeted areas of the house.  Often rabbits will attempt to graze on carpet, which of course, destroys the rug in question, and can also make the rabbit sick.  Some rabbits never have this problem, and others are seemingly impossible to break from it, so it's all about trying things out with your bun, and seeing what works for you both.  . . If you have any specific questions about bunny training, or keeping house rabbits, feel free to e-mail me (hmelton@sbcglobal.net) anytime.  I currently have 3 sweet little buns living in my house, and have kept indoor rabbits for years.  . . Hope this helps -- and check out the site listed below for some good reading on the subject!"	1	4
How can I keep my rabit indoors?	put them inside large cardboard boxes with small small holes or vents for air to enter and leave.	1	4
How can I keep my rabit indoors?	Keep it indoors and when you let it out put it on a leash and follow her around. Bring her back after a short walk.	0	2
How can I keep my rabit indoors?	Adopt him as yours. Have him neutered and put a collar on him. Keep him indoors if you can and enjoy your new kitty.	0	1
How can I keep my rabit indoors?	do what alot have said, keep your windows and doors shut, if you want windows open, make sure they have screens in them, if you want your door open, make sure you have a screen door.  . . Its weird to see someone having a problem with a cat that was indoors and all of sudden it wants to go outside.  My cat has been indoors since she was 1 month old, never was aloud outside.  I can keep my doors open, even my screen door and she wont go no father than the door way, she wont step outside, if you set her outside, she bolts back into the house.. . I guess you can retrain her too, however you trianed your cat the last time, use the same steps again.. . For the person that says its unnatural to keep a cat indoors.  Well many vets say if you keep your cat indoors and dont let it outside it will live a longer and healthier life, cause its not immune to all those dieses that are out there for cats to catch.. . We just rescued a stray about a month ago, and we have her trianed not to go outside, we had her tested and got shots so she would be safe around our other cat and the dog.	1	3
How can I keep my rabit indoors?	you can get plants that they dont like, maybe get a couple of those and put then around your house. . have you got an indoor cat-tray - maybe he likes to do his business inside rather than outside - think about getting a kitty litter tray indoors if you havent already	1	4
How can I keep my rabit indoors?	Some people believe that if there is a sick person indoors, opening an umbrella indoors will make them sicker. Strangely, it is not considered to bring an already open umbrella in and leaving it open to dry.. Like many superstitions, like walking under a ladder or breaking a mirror, it probably boils down to safety and common sense. Walk under a ladder and you could knock it and the person on it down. Open an umbrella inside and you could break something or poke somebody's eye out!	0	1
How can I keep my rabit indoors?	Domestic rabits can be handled easier than wild rabbits and are breed so they are more docile - although I had one that knew how to bite quite successfully.. . Wild rabbits are sleeker, and self coloured, yo will never see a black and white patchy bunny running through the woods.  They are usually fawn, grey or sometimes black.	0	2
How can I keep my rabit indoors?	its fresh, and cold water, cats that have to stay indoors , enjoys the water from faucets than their own drinking water bowls. have you ever taking a drink in the shower while rinsing off? if so why?	0	1
How can I keep my rabit indoors?	You don't die immediately, but you get the same bad effects as the smoker himself, maybe more then the smoker sometimes!. But it just depends how much time you spend indoors with a smoker, if you are already doing that, try to avoid the indoor areas!	1	3
How can I keep my rabit indoors?	Go to puppy/dog training classes. Jack Russells are very energetic so make sure you exercise them a lot before training. They also have a strong prey drive so extensive socialization around cats, rabits, etc. is absoultely essential!	0	2
How can I keep my rabit indoors?	you need to slim him down. overweight isn't good for anything but it is especially hard on cats. Iams and Hills both have great diet pet foods. walking him is a good idea too. Do you keep him indoors?.. you need to get him active	0	1
How can I keep my rabit indoors?	Other than keeping the cat indoors there  isn't much you can do. The cat is a predator after all and is doing what nature intended.	0	1
How can I keep my rabit indoors?	I keep my dog indoors and I walk him.  I don't allow him to be all over the yard.  I play with him inside.  This way he is not bored and isn't left without any activities.  You can also buy doggie cologne, wipes, and groom him consistently.	0	1
How can I keep my rabit indoors?	I keep my cat indoors by putting the fear of God (i.e., me) into her every time she's near a door. Whenever she's close enough to a door to make a dash outside, I yell, stomp on the floor and clap so she'll run off. I've done that enough times that she's afraid to go anywhere near the door now. It's pretty effective.	0	2
How can I keep my rabit indoors?	I prefer to declaw cats, especially if they are %100 indoors.. . I like the double sided tape method.  They don't like the feel on their paws and won't scratch there.	0	1
How can I keep my rabit indoors?	Why let your cat outside? Cats are safer kept indoors. But I know I cannot change your mind about keeping your cat indoors...and changing a litterbox is better than letting your cat go potty outdoors, read some of the posts here on Answers about what some mean people would do to your cat if they happened to go potty in a cat-hater's yard!	0	1
How can I keep my rabit indoors?	If you truly love this cat and he has been altered, the only thing you can do is keep him indoors only! Not only is he terrorizing your neighborhood, he's at risk of getting run over, shot, poisoned or in a fight with a cat that does get the best of him, and possibly injure him very badly and also possibly transmitting diseases like Feline Leukemia and FIV. Make sure you get lots of toys and play with him often so he doesn't miss the outdoor as much, and a window perch is a nice thing to have for him to sit it and watch the outdoors while remaining safely inside.	0	2
How can I keep my rabit indoors?	I think you should buy or make her a hutch so that she's more secure. Alternately, you should bring her inside and make her an indoors bunny. If she's free in the garden constantly, she's also not very safe - because she's at risk of being attacked by predators like birds of prey, owls, cats, foxes. Also, if you keep your bunn indoors with you, she'll really become attached to you. Anyway, have a read of these sites' recommendations for cage sizes and security -. http://exoticpets.about.com/cs/rabbits/a/rabbithomes.htm. http://exoticpets.about.com/cs/rabbits/a/rabbitcageidea.htm. http://www.rabbit.org/faq/sections/housing.html. http://www.rabbit.org/faq/sections/rabbit-proofing.html. http://www.rabbit.org/faq/sections/outdoors.html. http://www.rabbit.org/journal/4-4/pen-living.html. http://www.rabbit.org/journal/1/cage-manufacturers.html. http://www.rabbit.org/care/living-with-a-house-rabbit.html. http://au.geocities.com/leaswebsite/bunnyhouserabbits.html - my site - have a read and hope it's very helpful!	0	2

Why is switching schools so depressing?	Switching schools is depressing because you have to start from the  beginning to get to know students, teachers, administrators with their quirks, attitudes and routines.. . Nothing is done the way you are use to it being done. You are always being corrected. No one wants to hear how you did it back, where-you-came-from!. . You are the new kid in school, class, town or perhaps heaven forbid all  of the above. Some people have very limited lives and that makes them overly interested in yours until someone new walks onto their little stage. Meanwhile you may feel like the new class hamster that bites off it's new babies heads because the children won't stop poking, prodding, picking and touching.. . You'll make friends, move back to where-you-came-from, (It won't be the same.) become one of them and someone else will become the class hamster.. . Meanwhile, smile, be polite, don't scream or cry, this to shall pass.	1	4

Why is switching schools so depressing?	Just so you know fresman year is the worst year.  You get no respect from the upper classmen either.  And all your so called friends aren't your friends anymore.  And if you're pretty be prepared for a lot of jealousy, even if you don't know the person.  I hate high school or at least the high school I am going to.  I am glad i am switching schools next year.	0	2
Why is switching schools so depressing?	So more concentration can be on lessons and less on fashion status. However not being able to afford the uniform should not keep a student out of school like it's been known to do in New Orleans. So a distribution & payment system has to be worked out prior to such a switch.	0	2
Why is switching schools so depressing?	Yes I would switch.  If the new teacher does not work out, you can switch again.	0	2
Why is switching schools so depressing?	depression isn't a disease that you cure. You just change the part of your life that is depressing you.	0	2
Why is switching schools so depressing?	I knew someone in high school who had this problem and she told me it was caused by having too much acid in her system.  I don't remember it all that well as high school was about a century ago for me.  At any rate, I don't believe that it's harmful, just an annoyance.  Try switching to stainless steel jewelry or a higher quality of gold like 18 or 24 karat.	0	1

HVDC tranmission has both inverter station as well as rectifier station... . Power generation in the power plant is ac. . . For Hvdc transmission first it convert ac to dc at rectifier station and then tranmission line carries now dc. Before distribution it is inverted.Ie., inverter station convert dc to ac..	0	2
how to get 277 V AC ?	Not only in India. Almost everywhere A.C voltage is supplied. . Most obvious reason is we generate electricity in the form of A.C. using generators/alternators and distribute to everyone as A.C.. D.C is used for high voltage(low loss) transmissions; Still the end user is supplied A.C. since most of our electric appliances(motors, lights, etc) use A.C.	0	2

how to get 277 V AC ?	Split AC consists Indoor Unit and Outdoor Unit. Indoor unit is like Window AC means throws air and outdoor unit is compressor.. Best thing is this that Split AC is very quiet as compared to Window's a jet engine.. secondly you don't need a big hole just a little one that u can say connector between both indoor and outdoor unit. And that small hole will also behind that indoor unit so it will also not visible as well.. . Moreover SPLIT AC that is costly in price but looks beautiful and noiseless.	0	2

how to get 277 V AC ?	1. AC generators: motors running as generators where magntetic field inside goes moves with respect to the pickup coils generating AC current (3 phase usually): most big power plants use this form of generation. 2. digitally generated AC: using PWM (pulse width modulation) or some other modulation scheme to create sinusoidal waveform. mostly used by smaller power plants, such as wind turbines, UPS, etc. 3. antenna picking up EM radiation which induces AC current	1	4
how to get 277 V AC ?	Of coarse it is produced. Whether the current direction does not change (DC) or changes alternatively (AC) the magnetic field will be produced. However, the field in AC case also alters with the same frequency of AC power, causing an inductance which leads the current 90 degrees ahead of voltage to maintain the Lens's law.	0	2

how to get 277 V AC ?	Molecular masses:. Mn 54.94. S 32.06. O 16.00. H 1.01. . That gives us 54.94 + 32.06 + 4 * 16.00 + 7 * (2* 1.01 + 16.00) = 277.14. . The water portion is 7 * (2* 1.01 + 16.00) = 126.14. . Percentage: 126.14 / 277.14 * 100% = 45.5%. . . Eriochrome Black T is a complexometric indicator that is part of the complexometric titrations, eg. in the water hardness determination process. It is an azo dye.. . In its protonated form, Eriochrome Black T is blue and it turns red when it forms complex with calcium, magnesium, or other metal ions. So, assuming you have a calcium hydroxide solution at pH 10 (for example), the solution will be red.	1	4

how to get 277 V AC ?	It depends on the applied voltage.  Divide the voltage by the resistance which gives you the amperage.  Now multiply the amperage  with the voltage, and that is your wattage.. W = V²/R. This is straight forward for DC; with AC things become a little more difficult, as because of the fluctuation of the voltage, the average is only .707 of the nominal voltage.	1	4
how to get 277 V AC ?	Assuming R, L and C are connected in series and v(t) is the supply voltage,. . From KVL,. . v(t) = v[R](t) + v[L](t) + v[C](t) ... (1). . v[R](t) = R*i(t) . . v[L](t) = L*di/dt. . v[C](t) = 1/C * _/`i*dt (integral i dt). . so, (1) becomes. . R*i(t) + L*di/dt + 1/C*_/`i*dt = v(t). . differentiating above equation,. . R*di/dt + L*d^2i/dt^2 + 1/C * i(t) = dv/dt .... is the required equation	1	4

Why don't I have an asthma attack during sex?	ASTHMA is a lung disease in which there is intermittent narrowing of the bronchi (airways), causing shortness of breath, wheezing and cough. The illness often starts in childhood but can develop at any age.. . At leas t 1 child in 7 [in the UK] suffers from asthma, and the number affected has increased dramatically in recent years. Childhood asthma can be outgrown in about half of all cases.. . DURING AN ASTHMA ATTACK, the muscle in the walls of the airways contracts, causing narrowing. The linings of the airways also become swollen and inflamed, producing excess mucus which can block the smaller airways.. . In some people, an allergic reaction triggers the asthma attack.. . This allergic type of asthma tends to occur in childhood and may develop in association with eczema or certain other allergic condition such as hay fever or rhinitis.. Susceptibility to these conditions frequently runs in families and may be inherited.. . Some substances, called allergens, are known to trigger attacks of allergic asthma. These  include pollen, house-dust mites, mould, and dander and saliva from furry animals such as cats and dogs.. . In very rare cases, some fods, such as milk, eggs, nuts and wheat, provoke an allergic asthmatic reaction.. . Some people with asthma are sensitive to aspirin, and taking it may trigger an attack.. . When asthmas starts in adulthood, there are usually no identifiable allergic trigers. The 1st attack is sometimes brought on by a respiratory infection.	0	2

why girls are beautiful?	"I don't think it is necessarily a ""black"" thing.  I am white and have mostly white friends.  Trust me, there are a lot of loud white girls too.  I think that maybe the young age might play a role in the situation.  As far as the girls that go out with guys that are ""gangsters"" and the guys that abuse them, well those girls are stupid.  Most of these ""gangsters"" represent excitment and action.  The gangsters might be throwing money around and those girls prefer to be around guys who have money.  Girls want a manly man and a guy that is dangerous.  It all goes back to the excitment theory.  Also, girls want a man that is strong and full of confidence.  Some ""sweet"" guys are often shy and are willing to allow a woman to run all over them.  Even though some women might like that power, but overall, most women want a man that can be a leader and not a follower.  It is a double edged sword.  We want a powerful sweatheart.  That is just rare to impossible.  So, yes, girls are stupid....but men are stupid also.  Why are you guys so attracted to the beautiful bitchy girls that run all over you and treat you like crap?  There are just as many beautiful nice girls.  They might not have the exact body of a barbie doll or a porn star....but they could still be the one for you!"	0	1
why girls are beautiful?	"It is like the movie ""Shriek"".. . What is beautiful to one person is a turn -off to another.. . So, for example lets say I really love girls with facial hair...I mean I think they are the bomb!. . And another guy would say that is so disgusting!  He could say that....but for me she is so freakin hot!. . Understand?"	0	2
why girls are beautiful?	i think its because of surroundings: most beautiful people have so many other people jelouse of them that always can come up with something wrong... (just to make themself feel better) and also magazines, you look in those airbrushed magazines and its like... you can never look like that, so it puts a beautiful person down, when really NOONE looks that perfect, not even tyra banks..(dont get me wrong she is beautiful). and to top it off, most goodlooking girls get some boyfriend jerk that cant ever just say you gorgeous!. oh and instant karma... i feel you to girl!	0	2
why girls are beautiful?	"its a way of explaining that different ppl have different preferences, and that we dont all agree.usually used when talking about paintings. but, its like thig:  i might think that short girls with blond hair that wear pink are cute, but my brother might think that tall girls with black hair and dark skin are cute (and we'd both be right, lol) but theres not a ""correct"" answer. whats beautiful is for each person to decide for themselves. (and i think that all kinds of women are beautiful, thank god for variety)."	1	3
why girls are beautiful?	Not only did they get published after the fact but it was her uncle, I believe, that had them published. There was a lot of talk because he has deleted quite a bit of the diary that would have showed her as more of a 'normal' girl. It was a beautiful story but I think it would have been more beautiful seeing her who she really was..no just a censored voice...	0	1
why girls are beautiful?	The media has a huge impact on girls' body image. Look at all of the magazines that are out there telling girls that they need to be beautiful, thin and perfect in order to be loved.  Look at all of the diet gimmicks that are out there and how quickly they come and go. Just seeing the vast array of information out there shows that girls are expected to look a specific way.. . I think that media expectations creates a lot of problems for young girls and women of all ages.  It creates superficial expectations instead of focusing on healthy bodies and interesting character as the most worthy parts of a female's life.	1	3
why girls are beautiful?	I know and I dont understand it either there are so many beautiful dark skinned women out there!And its all foucused on thin lite skin women.Now i am a thick white girl and im proud of the way i look.But i guess skin color is becoming look at the same way weight is and its wrong!Everyone is beautiful.	0	2
why girls are beautiful?	well...you already made your decision, so go for it i guess...but have you considered that the only thing you mentioned about her, is that she is beautiful. That speaks volumns to me, and my opinion and don't take it if you want, is be friends, get to know each other, and see if that beautiful girl can also be honest, trustworthy, faithful. There will be a time when physical attraction just isn't going to happen, and there better be something to make that relationship keep going. get the picture?	0	2
why girls are beautiful?	All I know is that Linda means beautiful is spanish.  You can go to various websites on names for girls and it will tell you the meanings of girl names.  Linda may be spanish but it can also be another nationality.  Mine is Japanese which means beautiful. I later learned that it's also African which means facial wash and Hawaiian which means sunrise.	0	2
why girls are beautiful?	"Because they don't like who they are. I've seen a TON of girls who over tan, and even some guys :S. I don' understand it, I'd rather stick with my white un-tanned skin then have it all leathery and full of cancer when I get older. I when that happens to you ""beautiful"" girls tanning constantly, I will simply point and laugh and say, ""I told ya so, that's what you get."""	0	2
why girls are beautiful?	Well it's simply because society thinks light skinned girls are more beautiful. I don't really think dark-skinned girls are pretty(well some are), but then again i don't think pale girls are pretty either. And i agree with that other lady! Stir up drama in your own race and let us black people make trouble with each other!. I'm just kidding!	0	2

how to handsew sequins?	To hand sew sequins, you'll need some tiny beads.  You come up through the center of the sequin, through the bead, and then back through the center of the sequin.

how to handsew sequins?	Today it is just  a fun tradition to color Easter Eggs  - historically:. . Intricate Easter egg designs date back centuries. The decoration of Easter eggs to further enhance their value became an art form centuries ago and continues today. Dyes made from vegetables, edible flowers, fruits, coffee, tea, leaves, bark, and roots were used to tint the eggs. Lovely designs were created by wrapping the eggs in ferns before tinting. The art progressed, with western Europeans becoming expert at creating intricate patterns in vibrant colors on the small eggs. . . Here are explanations of some of the many types of decorated eggs: . . • Etched: Traced back to Macedonia, this process involves dying the egg, applying a layer of wax in a design, then bleaching off the color leaving only the wax-covered areas with color.. . • Krashanky: The Ukrainian word means color, and these eggs are dyed a solid, brilliant color, often red to symbolize the blood shed by Christ on the cross.. . • Fabergé: Probably some of the most famous and most expensive Easter eggs known are those created by Russian jeweler Peter Carl Fabergé in the 1800's. The eggs were made of gold, silver and jewels and most opened up to reveal exquisite tiny figures of people, animals, plants or buildings. A total of 57 eggs were made. These are obviously museum artifacts of high value.. . • Jeweled: Designs are created by gluing any manner of sequins, beads, flowers, etc., onto blown eggs.. . • Cut-Out or Carved: Blown eggs are used also for these creations where a portion of the shell is cut away. The exterior is decorated, and the inside filled with a little scene to be viewed through the cut-out section. These can be exquisitely elaborate.	0	1
how to handsew sequins?	If your design has the sequins separated, the third answer is the best technique.. . However, you can buy sequins in strands, which makes application much faster if you are doing lines.  Not only does your basic hand running stitch work on those, but you can buy a sewing foot called a ribbon foot, which holds the sequins strand in place while you sew it down with your sewing machine.	1	4
how to handsew sequins?	these days you get a fabric glue with which to paste the sequins onto the fabric. The glue is quite good and the sequins don't come off even after washing. It is available with hobby shops where you buy the sequins.. . If you still want to hand-sew, it'll take a lot of time, you need to put the sequin on the fabric, bring the needle from the edge on the sequin through the fabric, and then again through the center to the other edge.	1	4
how to handsew sequins?	"Hand sew? usually you use a ""punch"" like a paper punch to push them through the cloth. Try a hobbie store or fabric store or deptment store. I think they are called ""stud punchers"" or something like that. Unless the sequin had a metal casting like a piece of jewelry does, you'd have to glue them on since there is nothing to run the thread through. I think. good luck"	1	3
how to handsew sequins?	"You're good. If it were an evening event in New york or Montreal, festive attire would mean to ""dress up"" - not turn up in shredded jeans, please. In California, because of the weather, it means that sandals are appropriate as well as pressed chinos. You don't need to go in a sequined dress or tuxedo but, if you do, that would be cool,too!"	0	2

The crust or surface course is actually only one of several layers of asphalt and aggregate the make up the roadway.  The thichness of each of the layers is depedent upon the underlying soil, the conditions that the highway will face and the use of the high way including the amount of traffic but especially truck traffic as they do the most damage to the road surface.

While legislation for public highways first appeared in 1916, with revisions in 1921, it was not until Congress enacted an even more comprehensive version of the act in 1925 that the government executed its plan for national highway construction.. . Officially, the numerical designation 66 was assigned to the Chicago-to-Los Angeles route in the summer of 1926. With that designation came its acknowledgment as one of the nation's principal east-west arteries.. . From the outset, public road planners intended U.S. 66 to connect the main streets of rural and urban communities along its course for the most practical of reasons: most small towns had no prior access to a major national thoroughfare.. . http://www.national66.com/66hstry.html	0	2

Why do you have memories?	In addition to the information of the other posts, there are physical differences in mp3 memory.  With the current (as of 4/06) technology and market offerings, any mp3 player with double digit memory capacity (e.g., 20GB, 30GB, etc.) is hard drive based and any mp3 with memory in MBs or single digit memory (e.g., 128MB, 512MB, 1GB, 2GB, etc.) is flash based.  What's the difference here?  Hard drives have moving parts and don't deal well with lots of sudden physical movements.  Flash memory is in the form of chips with no moving parts.  So, if you want a mp3 player for the gym or jogging use a flash based one; hard drive mp3 players are not advised.  It is a trade-off between resilience (flash memory) and capacity (hard drives).	0	1

Why do you have memories?	Memory in the brain can be triggered by our 5 senses:sight, hearing, touch, taste, and smell. For example, if a smell is to be recognized and to be kept in memory, nerve impulses from the olfactory tract would travel to the limbic system of the brain; this system is made up of the hippocampus, thalamus, and the amygdala which control a person's memory. When the brain receives an impulse of something that is reoccuring over and over again, it will store it as a memory so it will be remembered. So memory is mainly a series of nerve impulses and the storing of information in the nuclei in the cells of the brain that relay information between the parts of the limbic system and the cerebral cortex so that memories can be stored and recalled.	1	4

All other crew members including the first officer (2nd pilot) report to him. He is also responsbile for the safety of the passengers and the aircraft.  Commander is who commands the aircraft and his word is final.  . Air Force pilots are not authorised to fly commercial flights as longs as they do not hold commercial pilot licence.  They are flying military aircrfts such as fighter planes.  There are many Air Force pilots who fly passenger aircrafts of the military.  . If an Air Force pilots wants to fly a commercial aircraft he has to first join the Commercial Airline and get the necessary endorsement to fly the commercial aircraft which he wants to fly.  This is given after completing the necessary class room training and flying training.  For example, a pilot who is flying an Airbus aircraft can not fly a Boeing aircraft unless he holds licence to fly both these aircrafts as method of flying and cockpit are different for each aircraft.	0	2

These two action causes more attacks than any other.  People should be punished for their actions that leads to dog attacks.  There is another woman on this forum that as actively help people with your problem.  I think her email is alicebnnt@yahoo.com.  I know she will help she is passionate on this topic	1	4

My city just put a ban on pit bulls, how do we reverse the decision?	I have been helping other people out by gathering information and videos. Did you know thatI n World War I, a pit bull named Stubby captured the heart of the nation. Stubby was the unofficial mascot of the 102nd Infantry Division and was credited with saving the lives of several of his human comrades. For his valiant service, Stubby won several medals and was even awarded the rank of sergeant! He came home from the war to a hero's welcome and went on to become the mascot for Georgetown University.

My city just put a ban on pit bulls, how do we reverse the decision?	With all due respect, Pit Bulls are very dangerous.  I know they say they are only as dangerous as their owner makes them but, that is not true.  It's in their instincts to attack.  That is why they are being banned.  . I wish you luck on keeping your pet, I feel for you.  Truly.. But, I would not get your hopes too high.. Did you make sure your signatures were verifiable?. That may have something to do with them being ignored.	0	2
My city just put a ban on pit bulls, how do we reverse the decision?	Consult legal counsel.  You should be able to prove in court the correct number of valid signatures if you had them.  . . It's not going to reduce dog fighting.  They'll just use boxers or some other breed.  They should probably instead have instated a commissioned ASPCA task force to crack down on dogfighting.  . . If dogfights aren't a problem in your community, there is no reason to ban these animals because they train well, are excellent with children, make terriffic guard dogs, and are one of the more stable breeds mentally/emotionally.  If it's a community concern about attacks, they should ban Dalmations & Chow Chows.	1	4
My city just put a ban on pit bulls, how do we reverse the decision?	WTF. Can they do that? I would write to your senator! This is an outrage and dog discrimination! PLEASE TELL ME HOW THIS TURNS OUT!	0	2
My city just put a ban on pit bulls, how do we reverse the decision?	"Not too much hope here for pit bulls winning. You best read the following legal battle in Denver and all the appeal results. . http://network.bestfriends.org/animallawcoalition/news/postdetail.aspx?gu=animallawcoalition&np=2455. . The problem lies will all those owners who raised dangerous dogs for fighting, and all those pit bull owners who did not realize just how dangerous, even a normally friendly pit bull can be without a strict regimen of obedience training that would prevent the dog from being a menace.. . I am not against pit bulls, I happen to like them. I am against owners who never train their dogs (all breeds) and people who fight their dogs, or raise them to be vicious in order to guard property (i.e., junk yard dog). . . It will take a lot of work to gain public confidence for this beautiful animal.. . P.S. for rvogelpohl2001 and danjelho. The pit bull is no more dangerous than any other dog in initiating an attack. They can however, cause more damage than most dogs once an attack begins. Actually, for initiating an attack, usually for no apparent reason, the toy breeds are the worst. This animal takes a special kind of person for an owner, a person willing to make sure the animal is well trained and socialized. This entire problem is not the fault of the dogs, but of the people and what they have done and not done with these dogs.. . The American Pit Bull Terrier is the breed most people think of as the pit bull. They are in fact, a wonderful dog. I lived with one and I know.. . ""The American Pit Bull Terrier is a good-natured, amusing, extremely loyal and affectionate family pet, which is good with children and adults. Almost always obedient, it is always eager to please its master. It is an extremely courageous and intelligent guard dog that is very full of vitality. Highly protective of his owners and the owner's property, it will fight an enemy to the death. It is usually very friendly, but has an uncanny ability to know when it needs to protect and when everything is okay. The American Pit Bull Terrier can be willful and needs a firm hand. They are generally okay with other pets if they are raised with them from puppy hood.  For the most part they are very friendly, but not recommended for most people. Excellent with children in the family, they have a high pain tolerance and will happily put up with rough child play."" http://www.dogbreedinfo.com/americanpitbull.htm"	1	3
My city just put a ban on pit bulls, how do we reverse the decision?	Join the yahoo group pet-law.  There are many knowledgable people there and you can learn to help fight anti-dog legislation.. . Suggest and ENFORCE a leash law, that will actually work.. . To the poster who suggested contacting peta - LOL!!!  The 'animal rights' groups are not at all about helping animals, ESPECIALLY peta (who euths 85% of there 'rescues')!  It is about ending all domesticated animals and animal usage including meat/leather.  These groups are PUSHING anti-dog laws while feeding you the phony we love animals crap to get donations.  HSUS, Peta, DDAL, IDA, and many more or NOT animal welfare groups at all, but groups that want to stop you from having any animals at all.. . . BTW, more kids are killed by their PARENTS than PBs every year.  You have a greater chance of getting hit by lightening than killed by a dog.  Maybe parents should be outlawed..... . . Be careful with dangerous dog laws as well.  In my area, my dog would be considered dangerous if she chased a kid on a bike.  If my dog were to get loose and chase a bike (mine wouldn't but many dogs would) they can legally shoot her.  They can also legally shoot her if they *think* she *looks* dangerous.  And how do we know they are qualifyed to make that judgment?  They have to take a beginners obedience class with an already trained dog.  After teaching obedience for 25 years I know how little most people still know after an 8 week session.  I am obsessive about locking my gates for fear of what might happen should they ever get out.  At the very least my show/performance dogs would come back spayed, at most shot dead in the street.	1	3
My city just put a ban on pit bulls, how do we reverse the decision?	"I really hate to say this, and I know how you feel, but there's not a lot of honest options against breed-specific legislation (BSL).  Assuming buckling under this outrageous ban is not an option, and all the Pit Bulls in your city are verified as such, then the outlook is bleak.  You know it's wrong, I know it's wrong, and the people who signed your petition know it's wrong.  . Where I used to live there was also a breed ban against Pit Bulls, but my dog was registered as a ""boxer mix"" by the Humane Society.  There's always the ""Pit Bulls are not a pure breed"" argument, but since Pit Bulls are a pure breed according to the UKC and anyone who owns a Pittie, that's out. . All I can say is, be stubborn like the dogs you are trying to protect.  Petition again, publicly protest, anything legal to tell your city that this is wrong.  Bug those who approved of the ban until they give in, and never give up hope.   God bless you and all the dogs in your city.. . Also, as gothicmidnight pointed out, people who fight dogs won't be slowed down by another law."	1	4

My city just put a ban on pit bulls, how do we reverse the decision?	I live in Ontario, Canada, and there is a pitbull ban here.. . This is what the government said - . . Ban pit bulls . Muzzle existing pit bulls, impose other province-wide restrictions to improve public safety, and allow municipalities to impose appropriate controls . Increase fines up to a maximum of $10,000 and allow for jail sentences of up to six months for owners of any dangerous dog that bites, attacks, or poses a threat to public safety. . . . There were several highly publisized attacks, after that, they put the ban in.	0	2
My city just put a ban on pit bulls, how do we reverse the decision?	"""Pit bulls"" are being banned because of this legislation that gets put into place within the community/state/province/country.  This legislation is called BREED SPECIFIC LEGISLATION (or BSL).  It targets all ""aggressive"" breeds such as rottweilers, ""pit bulls"", doberman pinchers, German Shepard's, etc.. . Italy has over 90 different breeds banned from their country.  Eventually, the country Will be dog-less.. . The legislation is put in place by people that fear the breed...and has had unfortunate accidents happen to them or friends.  They believe it is sole the dog's responsibility on how it acted.  They believe certain ""types"" of dog inherently are aggressive, and therefore are menace to society.  They believe that they are qualified in making the decision on what breed is worthy to live or not.  They believe that owners of said dogs have no responsibility towards the dog that cause the accident and should be allowed to carry on with life as it was before.  Meanwhile the dog gets destroyed.  The media then plays into those beliefs to get more support to push the issue.. . To my knowledge there are several Canadian cities that have muzzle laws or ban the breed specifically, as well as many American states, counties, and cities that ban these breeds.  You need to look at the specific community under animal control to find if they have any laws pertaining to BSL."	1	3

The American Pit Bull Terrier isn't recognized by the AKC, but the American Staffordshire Terrier and the Staffordshire Bull Terrier are.

My city just put a ban on pit bulls, how do we reverse the decision?	I do not know why they do this. I know that Pit Bulls get a bad rep and I don't think that's right.

My city just put a ban on pit bulls, how do we reverse the decision?	Why do rich girls put Pomeranians in their purses?  Pets reflect your 'image'.  That said, Pit Bulls aren't really evil or anything, any dog (especially weiner dogs) will turn out vicious if you raise it that way.	0	1
My city just put a ban on pit bulls, how do we reverse the decision?	People won't stop doing it because there's a large market for them. So long as there are emotionally insecure people who need monster dogs as a surrogate penis there will always be a market for pit bulls.	0	2
My city just put a ban on pit bulls, how do we reverse the decision?	Your pit-bull whines because you have exhibited that his whining will make you react in a certain way that gives him attention.As a pit-bull owner pit-bulls love attention, and activity, and even if it's just to get you up and walking around the house to follow you, they'll enjoy it. My best advice is to get your pit-bull on a normal schedule of eating, going outside, and playing and the whining will decrease and eventually cease.	0	2
My city just put a ban on pit bulls, how do we reverse the decision?	If the dog is AKC registered (although the AKC doesn't recognise pit bulls) is healthy,  has a good show record, OFA/CREF scores, then you might be able to work out a nice deal.. . However, if this is a run of the mill pit bull (or worse yet, if you bred a pit bull and now have a litter of unpapered unproven unneeded pit bull puppies), then next to nothing. Every shelter in America is overrun with pit bulls, and unless you have a superior show animal, only the stupid will pay any 'profitable' amount of money for one.	0	2
My city just put a ban on pit bulls, how do we reverse the decision?	"Well, it is already illegal in some states just to have a ""pit bull""  Unfortunately that doesn't stop everyone. I think your ideas have a lot of merit. CE"	0	2
My city just put a ban on pit bulls, how do we reverse the decision?	there's a few dozen communities that have banned pit bulls because there has been a lot of media hype over people getting killed by pit bulls. the only controlled study on the subject found that only german shepherds and chows are more statistically more likely to bite. However, when a pit bull bites, it is more likely to be fatal. . A lot of this legislation has been based on statistical data from the CDC that breaks down dog bite related fatalities according to the breed of dog. Right now rottweilers and pit bulls are at the top of the list. Statisitics that break up dog bite related fatalities are inaccurate in a lot of ways. They do no account for the percentage of the dog population - popular breeds will obviously show up more than rare ones. Also, they do not take into account the role the owner plays. Because of their reputations, pit bulls are often selected by people who want a mean dog. You can make a golden retriever mean if you want to, but you wouldn't get one if you wanted to. So pit bulls end up being more likely to be mean b/c they are more likely to be purchased by idiots. I posted a list of resources over in the page about rottie v. pit bull, if you would like to look at that.	0	2
What are the different types of sins and how are they caused?	"Sin is the affect of an earlier problem.Sin occurs mainly after temptation has been acted upon by our spirit and body.Sin is something that if not repented of will lead to death not in the bodily sense alone but spiritual as well.""The second death"" as it is called is what punishment is aquired for the acummulation of unrepented sin.Actually if a person is baptized into Christ and has repented and living the Christian life as best they can there will still be sin.Thing is we then have the privledge to ask forgiveness of sins as long as we try not to sin which is what repent actually broken down means.To turn from sin.Sin actually is no worse than another sin for instance Christ only really spoke of one and that is blasphemy and it is the worst of all.Sexual sin is a biggy but only because when you are baptized into Christ's body then you have the holy spirit within you.So having sex you are involving the holy spirit which lives inside of you which is definetly not good.Sin for the most part is equal.For instance some so called christians say that homosexuality is worse than other sins but in reality if I looked upon a woman sexually it is no worse than if a man looks at another man that way or vice versa.Just remember that sin is an act not something we are born with as calvinists and catholics believe.A baby that cannot walk talk or have sex cannot sin!Therefore it doesnt need baptism as a baby as they say besides a baby cannot confess Christ as Lord nor repent of sins for it has none.Hope this helps"	1	4

Coz the bible, will show you how to overcome all other sin.. . but as a non believer, the wages of sin is eventually death, and eternal hell. Coz they havent repented of the only sin that needs to be dealt with for eternal life.. . its a long long story, ask God, read the word of God. you will find your answers	1	3
What are the different types of sins and how are they caused?	"Because, according to the Imams, women are the ""tools of Satan,"" leading men astray.  Of course they need to be covered from head to toe - anything else might cause a man to sin!

What are the different types of sins and how are they caused?	SIN is not believing the words of the Bible are true, also called unbelief. And sins are what mankind does because we do not believe the Bibles. 1 Corinthians 5:11 But now I have written unto you not to keep company, if any man that is called a brother be a fornicator, or covetous, or an idolater, or a railer, or a drunkard, or an extortioner; with such an one no not to eat. Mark 10:19 Thou knowest the commandments, Do not commit adultery, Do not kill, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Defraud not, Honour thy father and mother. Romans 13:9 For this, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not kill, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false witness, Thou shalt not covet; and if there be any other commandment, it is briefly comprehended in this saying, namely, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.Galatians 5:19 Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are these; Adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness,20 Idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance, emulations, wrath, strife, seditions, heresies,21 Envyings, murders, drunkenness, revellings, and such like: of the which I tell you before, as I have also told you in time past, that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God..  . This is by no means a complete list but all of these are sins, but all a Christian has to do is ask for forgiveness, believe you are forgiven and realize this was why Jesus Christ had to die, for your unbelief in God's word. Realizing you are a sinner by nature, you do not become discouraged by your failing.	1	4

What are the different types of sins and how are they caused?	Vanity is excessive self-regard.  It is a deadly sin because it is pride, which is the biggest sin that is root of others, the essential sin of the devil.  It causes us to look at ourselves rather than God and causes us to try to exert ourselves above others because we think we are god.  It offends God because His glory shines out in all the world, and when we solely focus on ourselves it denies him the glory that should be his.	0	2
What are the different types of sins and how are they caused?	In a nutshell, because of breeding, selfishness, ignorance and insecurity. People feel bad about where they are in life, so they put other people down in order to make themselves feel better. They don't bother to study other religions, so they have no tolerance for ideas that do not fit in with their own ideologies. Also, their parents never taught them that it is rude to behave that way.. . Jesus taught that we should remove the plank from our own eyes before we try to remove the speck from the eye of our brother. Sin is like a stained glass window; you can't tap one piece out without breaking the whole window. What that means is that God doesn't look at one type of sin and view it differently from another type of sin. We humans are the ones who put a value on sin. . . People are selfish, which leads to judgementalism.	0	2

how do I go about getting copies of letters of commendation prsented to me from city of san diego?	Your first answer is correct.. . Keep in mind............ . Times and markets are changing!. . In California with average homes selling well over $500,000, a 20% decline is $100,000! In any market 'timing is everything'! So, could you afford a loss of 25% of your investment all because of poor timing???. . This last up cycle was 10 years in many parts of the country. The downcycle now started in CA, Wash DC, NYC, Vegas and other hot areas of the past are all soft and getting softer.. . From 1990 to 1996, the average home in San Diego lost 20% of its' value! The cycle we are now enterng looks like it could well exceed that on the downside!. . With all the 100% financing, interest only loans, EZ qualifing etc...even a slight decline will cause many to be unable to sell for the amount due on their loans!. .

"How were you saved from sin-and born again as Jesus says ""Except you repent, and be born again..."" How didYou?"	"Jesus said that you must be born again in order to enter the Kingdom of God (JOHN 3:3-5). Jesus specified ""of the water and of the spirit."" When he gave the Great Commission, he specified that one must believe and be baptized to be saved (MARK 16:15,16) and that one must be baptized in the name of the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Ghost (MATTHEW 28:18-20). When one is baptized, one is baptized into Christ's death, simulating his death and burial, and then raised up to walk in newness of life, simulating his resurrection (ROMANS 6:3,4; COLOSSIANS 2:12). The Bible tells us that we put on Christ in baptism (GALATIANS 3:27), while ACTS 2:38 tells to be baptized for the remission (forgiveness) of our sins. Being ""born again"" doesn't refer to the physical rebirth, but the spiritual rebirth, and doesn't refer to reincarnation. God will not allow sin in his presence, so we must be washed clean by the blood of Jesus, only accessible through water baptism, not through the ""Sinner's Prayer"" or anything else not specified in the Word of God."	0	2
"How were you saved from sin-and born again as Jesus says ""Except you repent, and be born again..."" How didYou?"	You must be born again. no one will get to heaven unless there born again.

"How were you saved from sin-and born again as Jesus says ""Except you repent, and be born again..."" How didYou?"	When Jesus died on the cross for our sins, He not only died for the sins of the Jews, but for the sins of the Gentiles as well. Those who accept Jesus as their Savior and are born again, are adopted into God's family and become His children. This is for all the Jews as well as Gentiles.  IF you were not a Jew then you were a Gentile.. . The name Christian means to be Christ like. To walk as He walked and try to follow His example to the best that we can. When we fall short of the glory of God, we repent of our sins, which is what we are do to daily.	1	4
"How were you saved from sin-and born again as Jesus says ""Except you repent, and be born again..."" How didYou?"	Being born again means being born of the Spirit, and all the perfections that entails becoming part of your character. Simply claiming to be born again without the Spiritual qualities is open hypocrisy.. .

"How were you saved from sin-and born again as Jesus says ""Except you repent, and be born again..."" How didYou?"	There are Christians in the Catholic churches and the other denominational / nondenominatinal churches.. . The One Church consists of every person born of God.  God looks at the honest heart, not so much the denomination of the Church.. . Jesus is the High Priest that He can save people anywhere in this world.  It is important that the True Gospel be preached to someone.  For how can one be saved unless the Good News is preached to that one.. . The True Gospel is that Jesus Christ the Lord is the Only Begotten Son of God, born of a virgin without sin nature.  That He overcame satan's temptations and was the Sinless Lamb of God for the remission of our sins and rose from the dead because He was with out sin and regained control of the keys to death & hell.  Death had reigned sins the fall of the first Adam.  Now Jesus has the keys to death & hell.. . The wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life through Christ Jesus.	0	2

"How were you saved from sin-and born again as Jesus says ""Except you repent, and be born again..."" How didYou?"	We are all from Adam and Eve since they were the original humans.  Since they sinned it caused their children to be born with sin.  Every human is therefore born with sin.  We're not accountable for their sins exactly, only our own.  The only person who never sinned was Jesus Christ.  Everyone sinned in some way.	1	3
"How were you saved from sin-and born again as Jesus says ""Except you repent, and be born again..."" How didYou?"	He became the ultimate sacrifice for our sins. He hung for 3 days on a cross so that we would have the possibility of being saved. We are naturally born into sin. Note: you don't have to teach a kid to lie, you have to teach a kid NOT to lie. It is our nature to sin as lying is a sin. So, He came down, made Himself a man and was crucified so that we might live. He rose again on the 3rd day to show us that He would come again for us. There is a reason to live a true, Holy repentant life as He is alive and He will come back for His people. Those that do not choose to believe this way will be punished the Bible says by living in eternal damnation, Hell. Those that choose life and believe will be saved. How to be saved? Acts 2:38 clearly gives a path:. 1. Repent- tell God you are sorry for your sins. 2. Be baptized in JESUS name- not the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost it must be in HIS name. 3. Receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.  This is evidence that you have received Jesus Christ into your heart as you will speak with other tongues as the spirit gives utterance. . This is the best gift, LIFE, in the world!	1	4
"How were you saved from sin-and born again as Jesus says ""Except you repent, and be born again..."" How didYou?"	According to John 3:3. . Jesus said to Nicodemus that you can only enter the kingdom of God when your are born again.... . In other words heaven is only a place for people who accepted Christ as their Lord and Savior (that's being born again)	0	2
"How were you saved from sin-and born again as Jesus says ""Except you repent, and be born again..."" How didYou?"	There is only one type of Christian and that is a born again one! . . John 3:. 3Jesus answered and said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.. . God shows no favouritism to whom He chooses - He saves whom He wills - whether 'catholic' 'protestant', black, white,  fat, thin etc!. . Romans 2:. 11 For there is no partiality with God.. 12 For as many as have sinned without law will also perish without law, and as many as have sinned in the law will be judged by the law. .  There are many differences of dogma between catholics and protestants but if any are born again - they all have one thing in common - they are united in Christ and are no longer bound by those divisive man made terms!. . On judgement day God won't ask if anybody's Catholic or Protestant - He will see who has accepted His Son and allow them entry into Heaven to spend an eternity there!	1	4
"How were you saved from sin-and born again as Jesus says ""Except you repent, and be born again..."" How didYou?"	Because people need to know that they are born into sin, and they are going to hell without choice unless they accept Jesus Christ as their Personal Saviour.  I was going to hell before I got saved, as were any other born-again Christians.  There's no way to sugar-coat what's going to happen to a non-believer when he dies.  Also, the Bible says to spread the Word so that people won't die and spend eternity in hell.  So if a Christian isn't doing that, he is disobeying God.	1	3
"How were you saved from sin-and born again as Jesus says ""Except you repent, and be born again..."" How didYou?"	"yes...however i believe this has been greatly misunderstood..... . Jesus said, except a person is born again they cannot enter the kingdom of God....being born again is ""baptism""...you are spiritually baptised, or washed clean by the blood of Jesus Christ, hence dead to sin and resurrected to ""newness of life"" or ""born again"".... . water baptism is simply the physical representation of the spiritual baptsim ""being born again""....just like physical circumcision is the representation of the circumcision of the heart, and physical circumcision of itself cannot save you....these all agree as one ""baptism""...i suggest you read 1 John 5:7-9 and check out this question  http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AuRxzgcmGxx6BNwlJnurKe_sy6IX?qid=1006051635169   . . it is an important passage to understand baptism...pray over it, and may the Lord show you the truth hidden in its words..."	0	2

How do you improve fuel efficiency of a 2004, Ford Ikon?	Be light footed on the gas pedal... smooth acceleration... renew air filter... OHC gaps correct gaps... clean and in good condition spark plugs... tune carb/fuel injection system.  That would do it. Driving around in a car out of tune is expensive on fuel !!  A car out of tune will have lower performance and the driver, to compensate for that,  instinctively uses more gas -- ie. heavier on the gas pedal.  Nearly forgot, take a compression test and all pistons. They  should have similar compression readings, around the 150 psi mark (check manufacturer's data for precise figure)	1	3

How do you improve fuel efficiency of a 2004, Ford Ikon?	One of the other responses is correct in one sense that the ultimate efficiency of an internal combustion engine is determined by its compression ratio and operating temperature.  However, those things being equal, the engine with the lower amount of rotating mass will produce more output power per unit of fuel.  As one of the responses mentioned, lighter pistons can affect the efficiency, as can the design, e.g., a roller cam, overhead cam designs vs. rocker arms, a shorter stroke (sometimes), can all affect the comparative efficiency.  One glaring example of how rotating mass and internal friction can affect such is that better oils can improve fuel efficiency by reducing internal friction and lighter pistons can as well by reducing the amount of internal poser usage to accelerate and decelerate the pistons as they travel.	1	4

How do you improve fuel efficiency of a 2004, Ford Ikon?	The addition of ethanol in gasoline fuel in small amounts (10%-ish) will boost the octane level of the gasoline while doing little to nothing to the efficiency. It is also proported to help the gasoline burn a little cleaner and reduce emissions.. The lastest thing is to use high percentage ethanol (85%). The fuel acts a little differently, so the car you use it in need to be capable of handling the different fuel charge. Generally, these high ethanol content fuels burn cleaner then the normal gasoline, but the heating value of the mix is lower, so you don't get as much energy out of the fuel (use more fuel). The jury is out as to whether the cost vs. fuel efficiency will work out favorably. Also some questions about availability of ethanol production and distributio	1	4

How do you improve fuel efficiency of a 2004, Ford Ikon?	"VOLUMETRIC EFFICIENCY. The key to producing power in an internal combustion engine is volumetric efficiency. An engine can make more power with the same amount of fuel if it can get more air(or specifically oxygen) into the combustion chamber and then vent that gas. Turbochargers and superchargers force more air into the intake of a motor. Some manufacturers these days are favoring the turbocharger because it is ""free energy"" since it runs off the exhaust gases where as a supercharger usually runs off the serpentine belt in effect making the engine work harder than it would without the supercharger. In the end, car manufacturers have started using more turbochargers these days to get better fuel mileage out of that vehicle and sell more cars to make more money."	1	3

How do you prevent chicken from drying out when you cook it?	The dark meat of the chicken retains moistness more so than the breast meat. Try recipes using legs and thighs instead of breast meat.

If, however, your fried chicken is dark meat (and hopefully boneless), you can put it cold into your baking pan and add cheese and sauce and bake it.. .

How do you prevent chicken from drying out when you cook it?	Never underestimate the power of a perfectly roasted chicken. A classic example of the beauty of simplicity, roast chicken has the power to comfort, to satisfy, and to impress. The inviting aroma of a juicy roasting bird is enough to make anyone's mouth water, and by the time the chicken emerges from the oven, golden crispy skin sliced through to reveal the tender, moist meat within, everyone will be crazy with anticipation. You don't need to tell them how easy it was to make. Just smile and let them exalt you.. . A Many-Splendored Bird. Roasting a chicken takes a little longer than some other methods of cooking this universally popular bird, but it actually requires very little preparation time-it's mostly just a matter of patience in waiting for the bundle of joy to finish roasting. Another merit of roast chicken is that the leftovers just keep on giving. Roasting two chickens is just as easy as roasting one chicken, and today's roast chicken dinner is tomorrow's chicken enchiladas, chicken soup, chicken salad, chicken fettuccine Alfredo, or chicken sandwich. As if that weren't enough, roast chicken is wonderfully economical, too! Pound for pound, whole chickens are much cheaper than a package of chicken breasts, thighs, or legs.. . Skin is In. Chicken skin contains a great deal of fat, and many people are in the habit of removing it in order to avoid the extra calories. Crispy, fragrant roast chicken skin is absolutely delicious, and, many people insist, the best part of the roast chicken. If you choose to pass up the temptation, though, you still need to leave the skin on the chicken during roasting. Roasting a skinless bird is an exercise in futility. The skin holds in moisture and juiciness. If you skin the chicken before you roast it, the meat will become bone-dry long before it's cooked through. You can carve the chicken then remove the skin from your portion as you see fit. Don't worry-there is no significant difference in calories between removing the skin before or after cooking!. . Divine Brine. One secret to really flavorful, juicy roast chicken is brining-i.e., soaking in salt water. Kosher chickens are always brined before selling; this is one of the reasons that kosher birds tend to taste better. To brine a chicken, dissolve 1/2 cup kosher salt in 1/2 gallon of water, immerse the chicken in the solution and place immediately in the refrigerator. You should let it soak for at least 3 hours, but overnight is great too. When you're ready to cook the chicken, pour out the brine, rinse the chicken cold running water so it won't taste excessively salty, then pat it dry with paper towels. You can still achieve a delicious roast chicken even without brining, but do give it a try sometime. You'll love the results.. . Dress it Up. If you decide to forego the brining step, just remove the chicken from the package, rinse it with cool water, and then pat it dry with paper towels. Rinsing removes residue and some surface bacteria, and drying off the chicken ensures that the skin will brown. Now for the fun part: seasoning! A chicken roasted with nothing but salt, pepper, and butter is very tasty indeed, but it's also easy to build on top of these simple flavors. Herbs are always a good idea. You can chop them up and tuck them under the chicken's skin along with a few pats of butter, or you can simply stuff handfuls of them into the chicken cavity. Wedges of aromatic fruits such as lemons or oranges, and aromatic vegetables such as onions and garlic are great to stuff in with the herbs as well. Filling the cavity with good-smelling things will perfume the bird as it roasts, infusing the meat with incomparable flavor.. . Another approach you can use is to make a blend of dried or fresh ground spices and rub them under the chicken's skin and inside the cavity. For a Southwestern flavor, try chile powder or pureed fresh chiles, cumin, and sage. For an Indian-inspired bird, 	1	4

How do you prevent chicken from drying out when you cook it?	heat your pan on high with grease melting. make sure your chicken is throughly washed and all the fat is gone. Well all the fat that is on the sides of the chicken that will cook off while frying. Make a batter of flour, seasoning salt, and chicken seasoning if your desire. Most people use an egg wash or buttermilk to coat the chicken in and then batter it but I don't. Once your oil or grease is heated and ready slowly put battered chicken in the frying pan and once the firat side has cooked, turn the temperature down to medium or medium-high. Finish cooking the rest of the chicken and make sure to periodically check the chicken to make sure it is fully cooked meaning not bleeding or no red areas in the chicken. You could also use Fish Fry batter instead of adding ingredients. For spicy chicken add curry, red peppers, chilli powder, crushed jalapenos in batter or tabasco sauce while cooking. There is also a hot sauce called Spontaneous Combustion. This stuff will make any food very hot. You may not be able to finish it because your mouth is on fire.	1	4

How can we understand Islam and Muslims better?	Live with them. Spend time in their culture. Born in Texas, I lived in Iran as a child, for 5 years, up until age 7(1979- Fall of the Shah of Iran, rise of Ayatholla Khomeni). I grew up and watched an Islamic revolution tear a nation apart...or bring it together against a common enemy- depending on your view point. Since I [Americans] was the enemy, it skewed my judgement to think that they were wrong. But, do we not also make outcast those who dont agree with us? First hand experience is my answer at the core.	1	4
How can we understand Islam and Muslims better?	By reading the Koran.  Muslims often claim their religion is very close to Christianity.  It is actually diametrically opposed.  They deny the divinity of Jesus.  More important, perhaps, is that the primary focus of Christianity is forgiveness, while the primary focus of Islam is revenge.  Personally the true tenets of Islam make me rather sick.  And I've talked to enough of them in person to know Love is not the basis of that particular religion.	1	4
How can we understand Islam and Muslims better?	I believe the first step would be to realize that, like Christians, there are many, many different groups that would identify themselves as Muslim.  For example, Jehovah's Witnesses, Catholics, Baptists, and even the Branch Davidians in Waco all would consider themselves to be Christian.  . . Realizing that, you would have to consider which group of Muslims (people) you were trying to understand.  Take a good look at their situation.  Their actions, if they are Muslims, that is to say if they are Islamic, should be supported by, or justified by the Koran (the Holy Book of Islam).  . . I think that some peoples actions, commonly attributed to Muslims or Islam, could also be resulting from other factors.  I have read the Koran (in English) and it is mostly very similiar to reading the Bible in that It is a Message or a lesson from or about God.  Jesus is there and the Virgin Mary, too.  Alot of the same stories or themes,   and God, who is the same are in both Books. There are some parts that would seem wrong or strange or even quite different, but mostly, very similar.	1	4
How can we understand Islam and Muslims better?	Do research about their culture and about their religion, its the best way.

How can we understand Islam and Muslims better?	Good question.. . In dutch countries, the Muslim immigrants comprise better than 90% of all crime. Wherever your able to measure these things substantively, you find Muslims have very high crime but the problem is that Islamic countries are not transparent like western democracies. Basically, there is no accountablity, no reporting to the UN. No way to correct problems based on objective data.. . So, ultimately, I can only look to Dutch countries or historical data and conclude that Muslim comunities are horribly crime ridden. Consider the recent earthquakes in Pakistan. You could watch Muslin looters and criminals on TV. It took a long time to get in hand.. . But I think the crime your referrring to is Islamic war and terror. Almost all armed conflict worldwide is Islamic. Worse still, historically, Muslims have committed the worlds greatest genocides. Just the hindu genocides alone total in the hundreds of milllions, and that was with swords and fire!. . Slavery ofcourse is a great crime and Muslims are BY FAR HISTORIES GREATEST SLAVE TRADERS. BY A LONG SHOT.	0	2

It's really those extremist Muslims that corrupt the minds of many Americans, like you, who make the American public believe that Islam is a violent religion of suicide bombers and terrorists. Islam is NOT such a religion. Islam strictly condones any violence and acts of terrorism and Hell is the punishment for those people. Islam promotes peace, unity, and respect to everyone, even those who are not Muslims.. . Your question should read, ""How can we stop the spread of EXTREMIST Islam?"". . That's something that I would want to put an end to."	1	4

How can we understand Islam and Muslims better?	2nd most popular religion next to Christianity. Islam: 1.3 billion. Sunni and Shi'ite. Many claim that there are more practicing Muslims than practicing Christians.. . If any religion leads people to be better people it can't be wrong.	1	3
How can we understand Islam and Muslims better?	If you are confused in trying to understand the contents of the Bible, may I suggest in reading other holy or sacred books (for example, the English translation of the Holy Quran).. . I have met and heard people who cannot find answer or explanation in the Bible, but can find answer to their questions in the Holy Quran. Nowadays there are several good translation in English of the Holy Quran.. . Despite the differences in the teaching of Islam and Christians, there are some similarities. To Muslims, Islam is the completion of the teaching of Jesus. That is why some may find the answer to the question they are seeking in the Bible but cannot find it, they find it in the Quran.. . Some similarities in Islam:. 1. Islam teaches it's followers to believe that Jesus really exist and Jesus is the messenger of God.. . 2. Muslims believe in the story of Adam and Eve (but with different understanding. For example, Muslims believe human beings do not carry the burden of the sin committed by Adam & Eve. In fact Muslims do not consider that Adam had committed sin by eating the apple. He was actually tricked by Satan. Hence, he did not intentionally want to eat the forbidden fruit). . 3. Muslims believe in end of the worlds; in the existence of heaven and hell.. . 4. Muslims believe that Jesus will come back to earth near the end of the world.. . So, why not try reading the Holy Quran to find out Islam version to your questions.	1	3
How can we understand Islam and Muslims better?	I don't.  I can only judge by my personl contact with the religion.  Every Muslim I have met is a nice person and I find it very hard to believe the negative things which are said about Islam and Muslims.	1	3

How can we understand Islam and Muslims better?	will.  governments even in Islamic communities are against  the islamic union what make muslims know each other things like covers	0	1
How can we understand Islam and Muslims better?	Let me tell you some points:. 1. Sunni or Shia, both groups of Muslims hate terrorism & people like Laden. Terrorism has no place in Islam.. 2. Sunni Muslims do not consider terrorists as heroes.. 3. Yes, there may be some problems among Sunni & Shia Muslims in Iraq but those are just for political reasons. Every country has political parties who mostly have disagreement among them. And, sometimes it goes extreme.. . Islam has no place for racism & bigotry. That's why we can't conclude that one of them are better than the other.	0	2
How can we understand Islam and Muslims better?	I don't think that is true.  I don't hate any religion.  And I don't think the majority of the American people do either.. The majoriy of the Muslims I have met are sweet gentle people.  You have to blame the Islamic terrorist for the hatred  you are feeling.  Most Americans don't understand Islam.  Sone think that Islam is responsible for these terror attacks.  It's just ignorance.  I hope that you don't think that all Christians are bad.  I don't think you really do.  We are all human beings.  Some are more closed minded than others.  This is part of life.	0	2
How can we understand Islam and Muslims better?	Muslims value Islam above all.. Many Americans can read and write:. . this is not the point-. the point is the subject of the reading and writing.. The point is always the subject.. Perhaps you should consider addressing a SUBJECT  which you are divinely gifted to understand. The essence of Islam escapes you. Get over it and move on.	0	2
How can we understand Islam and Muslims better?	I don't believe your premise that Islam is the fastest growing religion.  I believe that Mormonism is growing faster than Islam.  Even without growth, there are twice as many Christians as Muslims, so your numbers argument fades there, too.. . I also reject your premise that the popularity of something makes it better.  One need only listen to pop music to see the level of crap that the people accept as good.	0	2
How can we understand Islam and Muslims better?	"Then I guess you Muslims shouldn't be attacking non-Muslims. Islam is a religion of intolerance and anger. Don't believe me check out 9-11 or look at France and all those burning cars , give me a break, or better yet look at all those Muslims the Muslims are killing- Vicious. Its kinda like saying ""the world misunderstood poor Hitler"" don't think so bud, People just don't tolerate evil  maybe that's why."	0	2
How can we understand Islam and Muslims better?	my dad always said that these people are kinda jealous of islam's achievement... but my teachers its one of the sign of the end of a day! where everybody attacking each other, muslims and non muslims....even with the muslims itself	0	2

"Well the black light is UV light.So if it is ""black"" how can it be ""light"" ?"	Its a high frequency low wavelength light.can you see UV? no right? so it appears black.. also its monochomatic that you dont see the tinge of other light or colour...	1	4
"Well the black light is UV light.So if it is ""black"" how can it be ""light"" ?"	It would be safest to use a UV (black) light, or sunlight.	0	2
"Well the black light is UV light.So if it is ""black"" how can it be ""light"" ?"	"Ozone is three-atom molecule of oxygen. It is very unstable, because of high energy of creation. UV light has enough energy to ""glue"" another atom to O2, but that energy is transfered to the ozone, and UV light looses it, so it gets bigger wavelength, lower frequency, which turns UV into visible light, that is harmless to the living creatures."	1	3
"Well the black light is UV light.So if it is ""black"" how can it be ""light"" ?"	"There is no way that you personally can tell be looking at them. You take them to an optical store and ask them to look at them under the UV light meter (or UV photometer). Your glasses should get a UV transmission rate of less than 5% to be considered ""UV Blocked"". Some lens materials block all UV light, like polycarbonate, so if you have polycarbonate lenses (often called ""shatterproof"" lenses) then you are automatically UV protected."	0	2

"Well the black light is UV light.So if it is ""black"" how can it be ""light"" ?"	Colors are determined by what wavelengths of light a substance absorbs and which it reflects. A substance that absorbs all colors is seen as black. White light is composed of all the wavelengths.. However the color spectrum carries more than just visible light, it also carries the infrared and ultraviolet(UV) spectrum, which is not visible to the human eye.. When white light passes through a black light, most visible light is absorbed, but ultraviolet light remains.	1	4
"Well the black light is UV light.So if it is ""black"" how can it be ""light"" ?"	"It is ""light"" just as red is."	0	2
"Well the black light is UV light.So if it is ""black"" how can it be ""light"" ?"	It is black because the human eye can't see it.. . The visible colours are just one tiny part of the light spectrum which runs all the way from cosmic rays at one end to radio waves at the other. Most of that light of course is invisible. UV light is one part of that invisible light spectrum.	1	3
"Well the black light is UV light.So if it is ""black"" how can it be ""light"" ?"	We say light travel in space with velocity 3 lac km/sec. It does mean the electromagnetic waves in technical term, not the visible light only. We are able to see as light a very short range of the spectrum of E - M waves (only 4000 - 8000 A wavelength)	0	2
"Well the black light is UV light.So if it is ""black"" how can it be ""light"" ?"	it's invisible with wavelenth shorter than blue	1	3
"Well the black light is UV light.So if it is ""black"" how can it be ""light"" ?"	Light can be thought of as wave.  Different types of light have different size waves.. Atoms and Molecules vibrate in a wave-like fashion.  When the  certain molecules vibrate at the same frequency (speed, size) as a specific type of light, the molecules will absorb that light and either reflect it or release it as heat (usually a combination).  . High energy UV light is bad for your eyes, but visible spectrum light is necessary to see.  Sunglasses are composed of materials that absorb/reflect light in the UV spectrum but allow visible light to pass through to you eyes.  Typically some of the visible light is absorbed as well, which is why the world appears in a different color or is darker.  . . To give an example, purple light is very similar in wavelength to UV light, so it would to be a huge stretch to find that your UV filtering sunglasses also filter purple light.  B/c colors are a mixture of light, all of the colors that you look at would be without purple, which would change their color as you see it.	1	4
"Well the black light is UV light.So if it is ""black"" how can it be ""light"" ?"	Black is the absence of light. So when you close your eyes, your retina is receiving no light, so you perceive black.	0	2
"Well the black light is UV light.So if it is ""black"" how can it be ""light"" ?"	I'm not sure i get your question.. . But a black hole in space is black because light cannot escape.	1	4
"Well the black light is UV light.So if it is ""black"" how can it be ""light"" ?"	I'm a bit more sceptical to the lens since glass normally blocks UV light. You need special glass to get the UV part of  the light to pass through. This isn't an answer to the question, it's just so you wont get fooled by the current answers.	0	2
"Well the black light is UV light.So if it is ""black"" how can it be ""light"" ?"	Black is the color of a total absence of light.. . And yes, black is a color.  Color is arbitrary... its the brains interpretation of what it receives at the optical nerves.	1	4
"Well the black light is UV light.So if it is ""black"" how can it be ""light"" ?"	Blacklight is the name of the Ultraviolet (UV) flurescent lights used to make things that reflect color (like white, and other light colors) glow.  You cant see the light it self very  much because the human eye cant detect UV rays.  ONLY flourscent lights have this effect, the incandescent purple bulbs with the microfilaments (most likeley like your bedroom bulb) cant reproduce UV light, it is just purple.	1	4
"Well the black light is UV light.So if it is ""black"" how can it be ""light"" ?"	"Outer space isn't black because of an absence of light.  It appears black because there is nothing to reflect the light off of in the empty space.  So, as soon as there was empty space, there was what we would see as ""black."""	0	2

"Well the black light is UV light.So if it is ""black"" how can it be ""light"" ?"	black hole is a mass of black matter where light cannot reflect.on the contrary light is absorbed and is totally lost.due to this loss time travell is possible which is completely a new dimension if the barrier of the speed of light is breached.black holes hav tremendous elctromagnetic forces coupled with cosmic forcess that ultimately leads to an explosioon of gravitational pull.the pull is so strong that even light is not reflected as a result.	0	2
"Well the black light is UV light.So if it is ""black"" how can it be ""light"" ?"	fluorescence requires that the wavelength used for excitation be shorter than the emission wavelength.  . . different flourescent molecules have different absorption spectra; while most absorb well in the UV some do absorb well in the visible blue.  pretty much any fluorophore will absorb to some degree blue light however.  this means that white light will excite the molecule but the emission will be rather weak.  UV on the other hand will absorb quite strongly so the emission will be very strong.	0	2
"Well the black light is UV light.So if it is ""black"" how can it be ""light"" ?"	haha because you see black when no light comes back to you.  the reason black ink or black paper is black is it is absorbing a very large amount of light.  the thing about a black hole is, its so strong it absorbs ALL the light that comes even close to it, so you see nothing but blackness	0	2
"Well the black light is UV light.So if it is ""black"" how can it be ""light"" ?"	they don't *project* black, that part of the film blocks light just as any black object absorbs light	1	4
"Well the black light is UV light.So if it is ""black"" how can it be ""light"" ?"	The visible Light is infact a part of the EM spectrum. . The EM spectrum is in fact a band of radiations of various frequencies having different wavelengths.. The gamma radiations have the maximum frequency and the minimum wavelength and top the EM spectrum. The visible light having a freq. of 8x10^14 to 4x 10^14, is next to the UV and preceed the infra red waves.. The spectrum may summarised as:. Gamma Rays, Xrays, UV rays, Visible Light (Violet, Indigo, Blue, Green, Yellow, Orange, Red), Infra red, Heat Radiations, Micro waves, Ultra high Freq, Very high radio frq., radio freq., Power Freq.	1	4
"Well the black light is UV light.So if it is ""black"" how can it be ""light"" ?"	Some have a different phosphur coating than regular fluorescent lights, which causes only part of the UV spectrum to be visible. Bulb black lights have a filament which absorb most of the UV spectrum.	1	3
"Well the black light is UV light.So if it is ""black"" how can it be ""light"" ?"	it is darker because it is compltetely black and black ink may be comp. black there is light shining on it and there is no light shining around a black hole.	0	2
"Well the black light is UV light.So if it is ""black"" how can it be ""light"" ?"	simple, a black hole absorbs everything, including light, and with no light reflecting back at you, it appears to you dark, ink or black paper does not necessarily absorb all 100% of the light entering it, but a black hole does	0	1
"Well the black light is UV light.So if it is ""black"" how can it be ""light"" ?"	Depends what you mean by light. . Light is part of a continuum of electromagnetic waves of which only a narrow range form what we call visible light. Radio waves are from the same family but we can't see them with our eyes.. So, the short answer is that we can stop visible light actually, for example by shining a beam of light onto a black background where it will be stopped (black absorbes visible light). But what actually happens is the black surface re-radiates the energy in different wave lengths to that in which it was absorbed .. So can you stop light - yes - can you stop radiation in general - no.	0	2
"Well the black light is UV light.So if it is ""black"" how can it be ""light"" ?"	That's because black holes absorb all light that falls into their event horizon, or the point past which you can't escape their gravity even if you move at the speed of light.  Black ink and black paper reflect some light-they aren't completely black.	0	1

Not saying that ADHD isn't a real problem - some kids really do need help for it - but that ADHD's draw factors are more compelling than those of depression and anxiety.. . Also, the fact that kids are sometimes prescribed drugs for ADHD instantly gives it controversy. Most kids who suffer from depression and anxiety are given counselling over drugs, so less controversy there.. . Plus, having it on Desperate Housewives definitely gave it even more attention!	0	2

why do anxiety and depression seem to coexist?	"1) Anxiety:  . Anxiety is a complex combination of the feeling of fear, apprehension and worry often accompanied by physical sensations such as palpitations, chest pain and/or shortness of breath. It may exist as a primary brain disorder or may be associated with other medical problems including other psychiatric disorders.. . 2) Depression:. Depression (mood)  . Depression, in everyday language, refers to any downturn in mood, which may be relatively transitory and perhaps due to something trivial. This is differentiated from clinical depression which is marked by symptoms that last two weeks or more and are so severe that they interfere with daily living.. In the field of psychiatry the word depression can also have this meaning but more specifically refers to a mental illness when it has reached a severity and duration to warrant a diagnosis. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) states that a depressed mood is often reported as being: ""... depressed, sad, hopeless, discouraged, or 'down in the dumps'."". .  Depression (geology)  . Depression in geology is a landform sunken or depressed below the surrounding area. Depressions may be formed by various mechanisms, and may be referred to by a variety of technical terms.. . Depression (economics)  . In economics, a depression is a term commonly used for a sustained downturn in the economy. It is more severe than a recession (which is seen as a normal downturn in the business cycle). Considered a rare but extreme form of recession, the start of a depression is characterised by unusual increases in unemployment, restriction of credit, shrinking output and investment, price deflation or hyperinflation, numerous bankruptcies, reduced amounts of trade and commerce, as well as violent currency devaluations. Unlike a recession, there is no official definition for a depression, even though some have been proposed. Generally it is marked by a substantial and sustained shortfall of the ability to purchase goods relative to the amount that could be produced given current resources and technology (potential output). One could say that while a recession refers to the economy ""falling down,"" a depression is a matter of ""not being able to get up."" . . Depression (meteorology)  . A depression (also called a 'low') is an area of low pressure caused by rising air.. This is opposite to an anti-cyclone which is an area of high pressure."	1	4
why do anxiety and depression seem to coexist?	The emotional pain that comes with clinical depression can be so intense that it makes living a torture chamber. In addition, the depression also triggers very high anxiety that is equally unbearable. I would equate the pain with being burned alive. People who suffer from extreme depression are looking to die to escape the psychic pain. It has nothing to do with whether you value your life or not. Once the neurotransmitters start malfunctioning to a severe extent, living is hell on earth. There are many great sites on the Internet that explain this in depth.	1	3

why do anxiety and depression seem to coexist?	"Anxiety is nothing more than a feeling of apprehension and uncertainty. Believe it or not some anxiety is normal and healthy. Chronic, and continuous worry, however, is not. Everyone experiences some anxiety even on a daily basis but people with Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) experience constant anxiety which often has no apparent cause. GAD may be mild and manageable, but, for some people, it is debilitating. It can also cause and/or aggravate additional health problems, both physical and psychological.. . People with GAD often worry about the same problems everyone worries about - money, health, families, jobs, etc. The problem is, people with GAD worry excessively and constantly. People without GAD have the ability to put normal worries on hold and focus on daily activity. People with GAD are often distracted by their worries and find it difficult to think about anything else.. . Many people with GAD also feel constant anxiety with no apparent cause. They wake up feeling anxious and can never pinpoint a direct cause. The anxiety never seems to disappear throughout the day.. . ""Unfortunately, most people with GAD assume that they are just a 'nervous person' and that nothing can be done. They do not usually seek treatment unless their anxiety is complicated by depression, panic attacks or alcoholism. With appropriate treatment, however, GAD sufferers can feel less anxious and function better."" -- Deborah Cowley, MD, in Psychopharmacology. . The cause of GAD has yet to be determined, and there is probably more than one possible cause. GAD appears to run in families, so there is probably a genetic factor. A major traumatic or stressful event may sometimes trigger GAD. Another theory is that the person with GAD has internal conflicts which have yet to be resolved. GAD may begin in childhood or later in life. Most likely, GAD has both physiological and psychological components.. . Generalized anxiety disorder is a relatively common anxiety problem, affecting 3-4% of the population, that turns daily life into a state of worry, anxiety, and fear. Excessive thinking and dwelling on the ""what ifs"" characterizes this anxiety disorder. As a result, the person feels there’s no way out of the vicious cycle of anxiety and worry, and then becomes depressed about life and the state of anxiety they find themselves in.. . Generalized anxiety usually does not cause people to avoid situations, and there isn’t an element of a ""panic attack"" involved in the prognosis, either. It’s the thinking, thinking, thinking, dwelling, dwelling, ruminating, ruminating, and inability to shut the mind off that so incapacitates the person. At other times, thoughts seem almost non-existent because the anxious feelings are so dominant. Feelings of worry, dread, lack of energy, and a loss of interest in life are common. Many times there is no ""trigger"" or ""cause"" for these feelings and the person realizes these feelings are irrational. Nevertheless, the feelings are very real. At this point, there is no ""energy"" or ""zest"" in life and no desire to want to do much.. . This emotional fear and worry can be quite strong. If a loved one is ten minutes late, the person with generalized anxiety fears the very worst -- something’s dreadfully wrong (after all, they’re ten minutes late!), there’s been an accident, the paramedics are taking the person to the hospital and his injuries are just too critical to resuscitate him.....""Oh, my God!.....WHAT AM I GOING TO DO?"" Feelings of fear and anxiety rush in from these thoughts, and the vicious cycle of anxiety and depression runs wild.. . Some people with generalized anxiety have fluctuations in mood from hour to hour, whereas others have ""good days"" and ""bad days"". Others do better in the morning, and others find it easier at the end of the day. These anxiety feelings and moods feed on themselves, leading "	1	3

why do anxiety and depression seem to coexist?	Anxiety. . Most people experience some level of anxiety as part of everyday living. When anxiety seems persistent and overwhelming, it can interfere with daily functioning.. . Anxiety Disorders are serious medical illnesses that affect approximately 19 million American adults. Unlike the relatively mild, brief anxiety caused by a stressful event such as a speech before a large audience or the first day on the job, anxiety disorders are chronic, relentless, and can grow progressively worse if not treated. Fortunately, most people with Anxiety Disorders can be helped to recover.. . There are several categories of Anxiety Disorders including:. . * Generalized Anxiety Disorder characterized by excessive, unrealistic worry that lasts over 6 months.

This method involves either the man or his partner squeezing (fairly firmly) the end or the tip of the penis for 10 to 20 seconds when ejaculation is imminent, withholding stimulation for about 30 seconds, then continuing stimulation. This can be repeated until ejaculation is desired. The stop and start method can be used with the squeeze method as well.. . Desensitizing Creams for premature ejaculation. Creams can be used to desensitize the end of the penis. They act like a local or tropical anesthetic.

since i have premature ejaculation problem, how to satisfy my girl?	"Premature ejaculation occurs when you ejaculate too quickly and without control. It occurs before or shortly after penetration. Premature ejaculation interferes with the sexual pleasure of both you and your partner. It causes feelings of guilt,embarrassment, frustration, and depression. Premature ejaculation will cause stress in even the healthiest relationship.. . The Cause of Severe Premature Ejaculation.. . 1. Extreme levels of arousal caused by the overproduction of sex hormones. Simply stated - Hormones control ""everything"" that happens during a sexual performance - from the erection to the ejaculation!. . A normal ejaculation occurs when sexual excitement triggers glands, located inside your body, to begin a slow release of chemicals (hormones) into your blood stream. The slow release of these hormones tells your brain to gently stimulate the nerves at the glans (head of your penis). As you become more and more sexually excited, your body produces more and more of these hormones. The sensitivity becomes greater and greater until you reach the point at which time you ejaculate. Under normal circumstances the production of hormone is gradual and a man has the ability to control the sensations of sex.. . Premature Ejaculation occurs when your body produces too much hormone too fast. Your body becomes ""over stimulated"". The head of the penis becomes so sensitive that you ejaculate almost immediately. There is absolutely no control.. . This Extreme Sensitivity on the head of your penis causes the ejaculatory mechanism, inside your body, to go into ""spasms"". It's these spasms that cause the overpowering Urge to Ejaculate. The head of your penis becomes so sensitive and the urge is so strong that you ejaculate immediately.. If you slow down the production of excess hormone - you slow down the ejaculation.. . In fact, there's NO product, exercise, or technique that can stop severe premature ejaculation when used alone. NONE! Severe premature ejaculation is an extremely complex condition the causes of premature ejaculation are both physical and psychological. To cure premature ejaculation requires a combination of products that simultaneously attack and eliminate each cause. Only Last-Longer has a combination of products strong enough to eliminate ALL aspects of both the physical and psychological causes of premature ejaculation.. Quite often, when a man gains good ejaculatory control, he suddenly becomes much more interested in sex. And even if he doesn't, it might be nicer for both of you if he lasted longer.. . Faced with involuntary ejaculation, most men try to distract themselves during intercourse, believing that by thinking about other things, they can trick themselves into lasting longer. Usually, that only makes things worse.. . Don't tune out your body. TUNE INTO IT. You need to become more familiar with your different levels of sexual arousal. You also need to recognize how you feel as you approach your point of ejaculatory inevitability, the ""point of no return."" Once you recognize how you feel close to your point of no return, it's not difficult to make small sexual adjustments that allow you to remain highly aroused without ejaculating.. . Sexual arousal is a four-phase process. In the Excitement Phase, breathing deepens and erection begins. In the Plateau Stage, erection becomes full and you feel highly aroused. When arousal builds to a certain point, the next phase occurs, Orgasm with Ejaculation. Then during the Resolution Phase, breathing returns to normal and erection subsides. The key to ejaculatory control is to extend the Plateau Phase, to maintain arousal without triggering Orgasm and Ejaculation.. . If you want to learn ejaculatory control:"	1	3
since i have premature ejaculation problem, how to satisfy my girl?	The sympathetic nervous system, one half of the Autonomic nervouse system, controls ejaculation in men thru seratonin a neurotransmitter that has a key affect on peristalsis. SSRI inhibit the reuptake of this from the synaptic cleft.This can cause a premature ejaculation,the reason it may cause a delayed ejaculation or anorgasmia is that since seratonin is not being replenished back across the synaptic cleft  the membrane potentiala may not be repolarizing, but this is just a somewhat educated geuss, I would like to see if any one else can clear this up a little more.	0	2

what does 5 by 5 mean?	If you collected data about the heights of adults in your town, there would be a whole range of heights from less than 5 feet to over 6 feet. You could find the arithmetic mean (average) by adding up all the heights and dividing by the number of people. The standard deviation is a fancy way of working out what the average deviation from that mean is. It tells you a little bit more about a population that a simple mean does. For example, two towns might have the same mean height, but one town might be very multicultural and would have a large range of heights (large SD), whereas a very mono-cultural population would mostly fall within a small range (small SD).. . Here are two samples both with the same mean, but very different standard deviations:. . Sample A:  5, 8, 5, 3, 1, 4, 5, 5, 2, 3, 8, 5, 4, 6  (Mean = 4.57; SD = 1.98).

what does 5 by 5 mean?	Standard Deviation, a number representing how closely bunched a set of numbers is around its mean, or average value. The standard deviation is an important concept in statistics because it is a precise indicator of the degree of variability within a set of numbers. A set with a smaller standard deviation consists of more closely bunched numbers than a set with a larger standard deviation. If the test scores of a class were 76, 80, 82, 85, and 91, for example, the standard deviation would be about 5.04, reflecting the fact that the scores are fairly close together. A class with the wildly varying test scores 0, 53, 77, 91, and 100, however, would have a standard deviation of about 35.8.. . The standard deviation of a set of numbers is calculated using the deviation of individual numbers from the set’s mean. Each deviation is found by subtracting the number from the mean. If there are n members in a set and the deviations of the members from the mean are symbolized by x1 through xn, the standard deviation (σ) is given by the formula: .  . . . To compute the standard deviation of the set {2, 3, 5, 6, 9}, for example, first find the mean. The mean is the sum of all the members of a set divided by the number of members of the set: (2 + 3 + 5 + 6 + 9)/5 = 25/5 = 5. The individual deviations from the mean are 5 – 2 = 3, 5 – 3 = 2, 5 – 5 = 0, 5 – 6 = -1, and 5 - 9 = -4. Square the individual deviations and add them together: 32 + 22 + 02 + (-1)2 + (-4)2 = 9 + 4 + 0 + 1 + 16 = 30. Divide the result by the number of members of the set: 30/5 = 6. Take the square root and round to two decimal places: √6 = 2.45. The standard deviation of {2, 3, 5, 6, 9}, therefore, is 2.45.. . This equation works for sets in which all members are specified. A more complex equation is necessary to determine the standard deviation of a set using only a sample of that set’s elements.. . OR:. Standard deviation is a statistical measure of dispersion: a statistical measure of the amount by which a set of values differs from the arithmetical mean, equal to the square root of the mean of the differences' squares	0	2

What's the Definition of a bloody mary?	"Mary I, the queen of England from 1553 to 1558 became known as ""Bloody Mary"" during the reign of her successor, Elizabeth on account of the perceived ferocity of her religious persecutions; she has borne the epithet ever since. ""Bloody Mary"" is also a name for a ghost or witch who appears in children's folklore; other very similar tales use different names.. . Several fictional characters are also called Bloody Mary. . In folklore and children's street culture, ""Bloody Mary"" is the name of a children's game in which a ghost or witch of the same name (or sometimes other names, such as Mary Worth) is said to appear in a mirror when summoned. One of the more common ways participants attempt to make her appear is to stand before a mirror in the dark and repeat her name three times, though there are many variations. Some include chanting a hundred times, chanting at midnight, spinning around, or rubbing one's eyes. Most of these are meant to disorient people. In some versions of the legend, the summoner must say ""Bloody Mary, I killed your son!"" (or ""I killed your baby""). In these variants, Bloody Mary is often believed to be the spirit of a mother (often a widow) who murdered her children, or a woman who was murdered shortly before or after her wedding. In stories where Mary is supposed to have been wrongly accused of killing her children, the querent might say ""I believe in Mary Worth."" This is similar to another game involving the summoning of The Bell Witch in a mirror at midnight. Similar rituals are also used to summon spirits in the movies Beetlejuice (1988) and Candyman (1992). The game is often a test of courage, as it is said that if Bloody Mary is summoned, she would murder the summoner, often in a quite violent way, such as gouging out his or her eyes. Other variations say that the querent must not look directly at her, but at her image in the mirror; she will then reveal the querent's future, particularly concerning marriage and children.. . Bloody Mary Worth is typically described as a child-murderess who lived in the locality where the legend has taken root about a century ago. There is often a specific local graveyard or tombstone that becomes attached to the legend.. . On the other hand, various people have surmised that the lore about taunting Bloody Mary about her baby may relate her tenuously to folklore about Queen Mary I. ([1], [2]) The queen's life was marked by a number of miscarriages or false pregnancies. Had Mary I successfully borne a child, this would have established a Roman Catholic succession and threatened the continuance of her religious persecutions after her death. Speculation exists that the miscarriages were deliberately induced. As a result, some retellings of the tale make Bloody Mary the queen driven to madness by the loss of her children. ([3]) It is likely, however, that Queen Mary I provided only her nickname to the Bloody Mary of folklore.. . She is also confused in some tellings of the story with Mary Queen of Scots. Bloody Mary is sometimes said to have bathed in the blood of her child victims in order to retain a youthful complexion; this would appear to confound her with Elizabeth Báthory.. . The mirror ritual by which Bloody Mary is summoned may also relate to a form of divination involving mirrors and darkness that was once performed on Halloween. While as with any sort of folklore the details may vary, this particular tale encouraged young women to walk up a flight of stairs backwards, holding a candle and a hand mirror, in a darkened house. As they gazed into the mirror, they were supposed to be able to catch a view of their future husband's face. There was, however, a chance that they would see the skull-face of the Grim Reaper instead; this meant, of course, that they were destined to die before they married."	0	2
What's the Definition of a bloody mary?	"(from Ferdinand Petiot) . The most commonly accepted theory is that the Bloody Mary was born at Harry's American Bar in Paris in the 1920s, spurred by the arrival of the first tins of tomato juice from the United States, according to Dale DeGroff in ""The Craft of the Cocktail"" (Clarkson Potter, $35, 230 pages). Vodka was relatively new in Paris at the time, thanks to Russian emigres fleeing the Bolshevik revolution, and bartenders were mixing it with just about anything. . . The man credited with the drink's invention is Harry's bartender Ferdinand Petiot. When Petiot crossed the Atlantic in the 1930s to run the King Cole Bar in the St. Regis Hotel in New York City, he made a few changes to his creation. He used gin, according to DeGroff, because vodka was not yet available in the United States. And he renamed the drink the Red Snapper because the term ""Bloody Mary"" wasn't deemed acceptable at the time. When the drink flipped back to vodka, it resumed its original name. . . That name may have blue-blooded roots (the English Tudor queen) or a more blue-collar origin (a Harry's regular named Mary). Another theory appeared in The Chronicle's 1975 obituary for Petiot: An American entertainer who sampled the cocktail at Harry's said it reminded him of a Chicago club called the Bucket of Blood. . . Over time, the basic recipe has evolved to include vodka, tomato juice, horseradish, Worcestershire sauce, lime or lemon juice, celery salt and black pepper, with Tabasco sauce optional. Just as coffee can run the gamut from black to caramel-mocha-frappa-whappa, the Bloody Mary is prone to variation. These include the Bloody Caesar (made with clam juice), Bloody Maria (tequila), Bloody Bull (beef bouillon), and others made with beer and sake."	1	4
What's the Definition of a bloody mary?	"Bloody Mary Cocktail Timeline. . 1926: Fernand Petiot, an American bartender at Harry's New York Bar in Paris mixes equal parts tomato juice and vodka. Petiot says: ""One of the boys suggested we call the drink 'Bloody Mary' because it reminded him of the Bucket of Blood Club in Chicago, and a girl there named Mary."". . 1927: This is the year that George Jessel claims to have invented the Bloody Mary in his Palm Beach home. He claims the name happened when his friend Mary spilled some of the concoction on her shirt and she said, ""Now, you can call me Bloody Mary, George!"". . 1934: Petiot moves to the King Cole Bar at the St. Regis in New York. His drink becomes popular with New Yorkers but something is missing. The hotel asks him to change the name to the Red Snapper, but it doesn't catch on and it is again called the Bloody Mary. His patrons encourage him to make the drink spicy, so he adds cayenne pepper, black pepper, Worcestershire sauce, lemon, and a big dash of Tabasco® sauce. The recipe is a hit.. . March 30, 1956: George Jessel takes out an ad in Collier's that reads: “I think I invented The Bloody Mary, Red Snapper, Tomato Pickup or Morning Glory. It happened on a Night before a Day and I felt I should take some good, nourishing tomato juice, but what I really wanted was some of your good Smirnoff Vodka. So I mixed them together, the juice for body and the vodka for spirit, and if I wasn't the first ever, I was the happiest ever.”. . Aug. 15, 1956: The Bloody Mary is mentioned in Punch magazine: ""Those two ... are eating raw steaks and drinking Bloody Marys.”. . July 18, 1964: Petiot tells the New Yorker: ""I initiated the Bloody Mary of today. George Jessel said he created it, but it was really nothing but vodka and tomato juice when I took it over. I cover the bottom of the shaker with four large dashes of salt, two dashes of black pepper, two dashes of cayenne pepper, and a layer of Worcestershire sauce; I then add a dash of lemon juice and some cracked ice, put in two ounces of vodka and two ounces of thick tomato juice, shake, strain, and pour. We serve a hundred to a hundred and fifty Bloody Marys a day here in the King Cole Room and in the other restaurants and the banquet rooms."". . Jan. 8, 1975: Petiot dies in San Francisco.. . 1976: The McIlhenny Company introduces Tabasco® Bloody Mary Mix."	1	3

What's the Definition of a bloody mary?	"The name may be attributed to Mary Tudor, the daughter of Henry VIII. In her brief five-year tenure as Queen, she managed to kill off most of her Protestant adversaries and became affectionately known as ""Bloody Mary"" to her nearest and dearest.

What's the Definition of a bloody mary?	"Bloody Mary: The Unauthorized Biography. Controversy and intrigue are just two of the ingredients that go into this classic cocktail. Al Martinez spills the story..  .  . RELATED LINK:A Better Bloody.  To sip a Bloody Mary in New York's St. Regis Hotel is to be in the presence of a greater power. Not God, but Fernand ""Pete"" Petiot, who, it is said, invented what was to become America's favorite morning-after drink, the hangover remedy, the compelling and infamous hair of the dog. . . I sat in the very room, the King Cole Bar, where Pete and the Bloody were introduced to America in the 1930s. While not quite a cathedral, it is nonetheless a lounge of exquisite secular taste, enclosed in the comfort of dark wood and dominated by a large mural of the merry old soul himself, surrounded by an entourage from the lyrical world of the nursery rhyme.. . According to drinking lore, encapsulated in Christopher O'Hara's book The Bloody Mary (with William Nash photographs of such glory that you want to drink the pages), the Bloody was invented by bartender Petiot at Harry's New York Bar in Paris. The basic recipe consisted of vodka, tomato juice, Worcestershire sauce, lemon juice, salt, and cayenne pepper.. . Legend has it that he named it after Queen Mary Tudor, or Bloody Mary, the Catholic daughter of Henry VIII, who, during her five-year reign, managed to kill off an impressive number of Protestants. Even by the standards of 16th-century England, the slaughter of some 300 ""heretics"" seemed excessive.. . Others ascribe the name to a bar in Chicago called ""Bucket of Blood,"" and still others believe it was based on the complaints of a London visitor to Harry's Bar who kept drinking Petiot's tomato juice libation while going on about his wife, Mary. Using one of England's most popular adjectives, the man declared his wife was a bloody nag and bloody impossible, among other bloody evils. So Petiot, in a fit of whimsy, named his drink the Bloody Mary. You can believe any bloody story you like, but most seem to prefer the influence of the bloody Queen.. . However, for those who cant toward a good scare, there is the urban legend of a woman named Mary who was injured in an accident that tore her face so badly she bled to death. Her spirit is said to roam about, and if you stand before a mirror and say Bloody Mary three times, her mangled visage will appear. If so, dash for the door or she'll rip you up, too. You'll surely need a drink after that.. . To continue the more likely tale, John Jacob Astor fell in love with the Bloody at Harry's, and brought Petiot and his drink to The St. Regis, which the Astors owned. Word of its existence spread like a dirty joke, and in no time at all, the Bloody became a standard morning-after libation and, later, one of the drinks favored at a modern invention called brunch, leading it to become at one time the third most popular cocktail in the country. Fearful that the name might offend, however, the Astors renamed it the Red Snapper. But that, forgive me, lacked the snap of the original and ended up in the barrel of bad ideas, where the mango Martini and the Pet Rock reside.. . There are as many ways to prepare a Bloody Mary as there are to cook potatoes. King Cole bartender Gavin Fitzgibbon, himself somewhat of a cocktail historian, assured me that his Bloody was concocted with the same recipe created by Petiot. ""We do not,"" he proclaimed in the grand style of a purist, ""attempt to popularize it."" Unlike those days in Paris, however, the drink at The St. Regis sells for $17, and while it is a very nice drink, it is not worth three times the price of the taxi that took me to the hotel in the first place.. . In quest of the elusive queen of Bloodies, I tasted samples in such diverse venues as a noisy singles joint called Gladstone's on an L.A. beach, Melrose Place's four-star Bastide, and the elegant Bull and "	1	4

Why do we wee a lot in the cold weather especially at night?	Because in the summer, we lose a lot of sweat yes? =] so, this sweat has to be replaced with water from the body, meaning why we drink more in the summer, BUT, in the winter, we hardly sweat, meaning a build up of water, and bingo, out it comes, its all homeostasis, blood and body temperatures =], Basically, the water in our body cant escape  through the sweat glands, well, cus its winter, meaning it just builds up and puts everything out of balance.

Frying chicken that's already fully cooked, unless perhaps it's dark meat, will dry it out and even though you put sauce on it to bake, it will still be dry inside.. . If, however, your fried chicken is dark meat (and hopefully boneless), you can put it cold into your baking pan and add cheese and sauce and bake it.. . I would recommend though that you preheat your oven first and make sure your sauce and cheese are all at least room temperature (preheating the sauce in a pan or the microwave would be better) so that the parmesan will not have to bake too long to prevent overcooking the chicken.	1	4

Fry in generous amounts of bacon grease or lard. Fry on Medium heat or else it will burn. Only turn chicken once about 15 to 20 min on each side.

how do i deap fry chicken?	heat your pan on high with grease melting. make sure your chicken is throughly washed and all the fat is gone. Well all the fat that is on the sides of the chicken that will cook off while frying. Make a batter of flour, seasoning salt, and chicken seasoning if your desire. Most people use an egg wash or buttermilk to coat the chicken in and then batter it but I don't. Once your oil or grease is heated and ready slowly put battered chicken in the frying pan and once the firat side has cooked, turn the temperature down to medium or medium-high. Finish cooking the rest of the chicken and make sure to periodically check the chicken to make sure it is fully cooked meaning not bleeding or no red areas in the chicken. You could also use Fish Fry batter instead of adding ingredients. For spicy chicken add curry, red peppers, chilli powder, crushed jalapenos in batter or tabasco sauce while cooking. There is also a hot sauce called Spontaneous Combustion. This stuff will make any food very hot. You may not be able to finish it because your mouth is on fire.	1	4

How do I know if a particular term or phrase is copyrighted?	"A single word cannot be copyrighted.  It can be a trademark, but that's different.  If you are not using it as a trademark yourself, I can't see what the problem is.. . On all these ""infringement"" questions, common sense and your own experience must rule the day.  Haven't you seen words and phrases, names even, that are used in normal newspapers, magazine articles, and books?  People say things like ""I'll go get a Coke.""  If it was illegal to use a trademarked name in that way, we'd never be able to say anything!  . . The basic rule in copyright is that if the ideas are, to your conscious mind, original to you, go ahead and use them.  If you purposely quote someone else, put it in quote marks and attribute it.  But if you just happen to choose the same words someone else in the past has used, that would not be an infringement.  However, if your entire chapter (or even a significant part of it) is word-for-word the same as someone else's, you're going to have trouble convincing a jury that you did not copy.. . Mama always said if you are honest, you don't have to worry about being sued.  That's something of an exaggeration in this modern litigious age, but it's about as good as we've got.

How do I know if a particular term or phrase is copyrighted?	"I know that in England copyrighting is free. You need to include the copyright symbol on all your published work, with your name and the year you created the work. I am pretty sure also, that all on the internet is automatically copyrighted as long as you use what I just mentioned. Check your country patent office but in England, like I said it is free.. It doesn't mean your work won't get stolen, but you will then have rights to sue them for infringement. With these copyright symbols on your work, you will have more chance of winning any lawsuits in the future.. Check it out, simply do a Google search for ""Copyright laws"" but if publishing on the internet, then nothing really protects unless you see your work being sold, then it's up to you to pursue what is rightfully yours.. Oh, you want to check if protected, simply ask Google, you'll know once been in there"	0	2

How do I know if a particular term or phrase is copyrighted?	You can do it the cheapo way - mail a copy to yourself with the post mark proving that you wrote the story before that particular date. (Keeping it sealed on the off chance it came up in court.). Or you can file for a copyright - www.copyright.gov/forms. Which will cost you. (Which I don't recommend unless you are about to get it published.) In either case, if you are going to send in a story for publishing, don't write 'Copyright, 2006 Bill Johnson'. (This is extremely tacky and editors will laugh at you. Off to the slush pile with it.). People tend to go over board with the copyright thing. There really aren't that many people who are going to steal your story. Potentially it could happen, but a lot of the 'YOU MUST GET A COPYRIGHT' is paranoia. .

Why do parent put kids on restriction?	"""When they know the kids will do the same thing?""  I want to try to answer your second question first.  Parents do not KNOW that the child will do the same thing again and they likely HOPE the child will not.  Any form of ""restriction"" is a form of punishment whereby certain privileges or even rights are taken away.  This is a model of how criminals are treated in our (U.S.) society.  Depending on the infraction, more or less privileges are taken away.  It is obviously not the best deterrent but would you rather that parents torture their children into submission every time they commit an infraction?"	1	3

Why do parent put kids on restriction?	how do we know the child will do the same thing over. Plus it depends on the age of the child. If he/she is a small toddler then grounding does no good. You put them in a time out spot or chair for their appropriate age. If they are old like 10 or older. Then yes grounding them or taking things away will have to be the consequences. The child must learn that for every action there is a reaction. It was his/her choice to behave badly. So it is his/her choice to take the responsibility for his actions.	1	3

Ok Violent games for one.Games do not make kids violent the parents do.For example the Bully that was supposed to be a big hit among parents as far as bashing goes.The Bully if anything makes kids respect other kids because the whole game you are protecting the weaker kids.Mortal Kombat that is the first bloody game people have ever saw look up violence from that game you will not see any kids trying to ''rip out people spines'' and so forth.Grand Theft Auto to tell you what I believe that shows you kids what will happen if this stuff happens or they do this stuff.As far as ''game violence''goes it is ALWAYS and I mean ALWAYS up to the parents.The parents decide if their kids get these game now a days.If you are under 17 you cannot get a ''M'' mature rated game.If the parents get the game that is their fault not the kids.There I wrote your report you pretty much.Use it as you wish.	0	2

Which auto insurance do you use and why?	I use Allstate, but it varies greatly by where you live, driving history, credit score, types of cars, married/single.

Which auto insurance do you use and why?	Most auto insurance companies require A-B honor roll grade averages for GSD info. Mid-Quarter grades are not shared with insurance companies - because, quite frankly, the insurance companies dont have the time to care. So, no need to stress too much over your kids midterm reports.	0	2
Which auto insurance do you use and why?	I respectfully disagree from my learned colleague above.. . As high as people think their auto insurance premiums in NJ are, they were not high enough from the insurance industry's point of view.  An insurance company, like any other business, expects to make a profit commensurate with the risk it undertakes and comparable with the risk of similar industries. . . Auto insurance companies in NJ were not earning such profits, mostly because the state insurance department refused to increase rates high enough.. . GEICO, like many competitors, refused to continue writing business at rates it considered inadequate, and left the state.  GEICO has only recently returned to NJ.	0	2

Which auto insurance do you use and why?	You need to contact the insurance company, to see if the policy is any good.  You ALSO might want to check up on www.ambest.com, to see the rating of that company.  . . Then you need to contact your state insurance department, and report that - it IS insurance fraud to sell insurance if you're not licensed.  Unfortunately, many of the policies are counterfeit, so that's why you need to contact the company, also.  . . I'd report it to the company as well, btw.	1	3
Which auto insurance do you use and why?	When your wife got the service, I'm sure she had to sign something that said they would bill the insurance company as a courtesy, but she was ultimately responsible for the payment. If you hire a lawyer, you'd end up paying $200/hr to him and also the medical bill. Maybe she should find out from the insurance company why they refused to pay the bill first. It's not the job of the medical providers to go after the insurance company. She should have taken care of it earlier.	0	2

Actually both should be fully investigated.	0	1

We have 6% of our county are illegals & they use 78% of our social service budget.This is according to our county records. They cause 42% of our auto accidents & only 20% carry insurance. They are bleeding our country dry.	0	1

Which auto insurance do you use and why?	Great question.  Insurance companies exist to make a profit. And, if your accident / insurance usage is below average, you wouldn't techincally need them. (Of course, for auto insurance, it's usually mandated by state law, so be sure to follow the law).. . Insurance companies make a profit by calculating the expected payouts/claims based on a lot of factors, including history, projections, etc... and then make sure that they charge more than they expect to pay out in premiums. The premiums of course are adjusted for higher risk groups. . . In the end, slightly over half the people insured willl pay more to an insurance company than they recieve, and slightly less than half will get more money from the insurance company than they pay in premiums.  . . Insurance companies, like banks, also invest your premiums to get a better return on your money.. . It's a real science, and insurance companies pay huge bucks to the people responsible for setting premiums and writing those alogrithms.	0	2
Which auto insurance do you use and why?	Actuaries for  Insurance companies calculate how likely it it is for some event to happen. Using these statistics they cna they figure out how much to charge so that they stiil make money on all of their policies. Some policies will have a claim and some will not. Essentially, it is like gambling. Just like the Casino, the house always wins in the long run. While some people will collect more than they paid in premiums, like some of the BlackJack or slot playes will win, most will not.. . As a consumer, you have to understand the risk of beeing uninsured vs. the cost of your premium. In some cases you don't get a choice i.e. auto insurance requuired by the government and house insurance required by the bank that holds your mortgage,. . In others, say dental insurance , you might decide that since you have never needed any thing other than a cleaning, you will not take the insurance and take the risk that next toime you could need three fillings.	0	2
Which auto insurance do you use and why?	I work in auto insurance--go with a larger company, the small ones either charge more or you're not getting all the coverage you think you are.  larger vehicles are cheaper on insurance ( I know it doesn't make sense, but trust me.  I do this every day).  Keep your record clean, accident- and violation-wise.  Being married helps.  Have other business with the company, like Life or property insurance.	1	4
Which auto insurance do you use and why?	You are required by law to have insurance when you're driving a vehicle. Insurance companies ARE NOT required by law to provide you insurance.  They want to make sure you'll pay for the insurance they'll be providing you.	0	2

The term ""husky"" can apply to any northern, spitz-type breed. If someone doesn't know the parents of a mixed breed dog, but it has some spitz-type traits (thick double coat, pricked ears, curly tail, etc.) they may label it a ""husky mix""."	0	2
Does anybody know where i could get a free guide on how to train a siberian husky?	You did not say what kind of training you are looking for.. . Basic obedience?  There is a lot of information out there and it just depends on the method or modification you want to work with.  It is best that you do the training yourself.  There are training classes everywhere you look if you want to do in that kind of setting to were there are a lot of distractions of other dogs and other people around.  I like to get the basic training done without all the extra distractions.  Once the basics are installed it is wise to go to different places so that the footing is different.  Like a walk down a side walk, walk them through a carpeted area, bare ground, think forest etc.  Also where people and other animals are so that he/she learns to be observant but will not break her training.. . If you want instructions on how to teach him/her to pull a sled start out with, say a wagon pulling a couple of kids or rocks.  I don't think this is what you were looking for cause you didn't say if you had several or just one.. . I myself like the behavior modification rather than the method training.  I feel that it is more reliable.  I have used this to train police dogs and personal protection dogs, search and rescue, personal pets and it works for all types of training.. . Good luck	1	4
Does anybody know where i could get a free guide on how to train a siberian husky?	"Siberian huskies are tough dogs but they are very smart and can learn quickly.  . . For basic obedience, I recommend you look at your local library for ""Siberian Huskies for Dummies"" or ""the Dog Whisperer"", both are very helpful books.  If your local library does not have them, you can ask them (usually available on their website) for an interlibrary loan.  . . A good website for husky-specific training tips was mentioned above: http://www.husky-petlove.com/husky_alpha_training.html.  I tried these ideas with my dog and had great results.  . . Some tips:. Huskies cannot be trained to be off a leash.  Period.  . . If you NEVER feed your dog from the table, (s)he will NEVER beg.  . . If you limit food (most Huskies only need 1 cup of dry food twice per day, according to our vet), then you can use food as a great motivator, even if it is just a small morsel of bread or a kibble.  To train your dog to kiss with his nose, you can say ""kiss"" then physically move his nose to contact your cheek, then say ""good boy"" and give a food reward.  After about 5 of these (s)he will be trained.  . . If basic obedience is a problem, make sure you are giving your husky enough exercise.  It makes a huge difference.  . . Good luck."	1	4

Does anybody know where i could get a free guide on how to train a siberian husky?	I always found in my experience with dogs that tying a small rope around there colar and make them stay and walk away with string in hand and when you get a a little ways tell them to come if they don't then give them a little jerk to let them know to come here! Now if you are having the problem where she wont even come when you call her like my stray husky did (i found out she ran the streets for almost amonth beforewe found her) It was extremely difficult we used the same tactics but she was hard headed by then. Most strays are very difficult to train i find, but with plenty discipline and i would try the rope tec i talked about earlier!! maybe it would help, my husky just loved to run for many years before she settled down lol	1	3

Why doesn't the bible make any sense?	The Bible and prayer go together.  We need to pray to ask God to reveal from the Bible what he wants us to know.  It's foolishness to non-Christians, and to new Christians God only gives them a little at a time, he compares it to babies drinking milk, they aren't yet ready for all of it.  Spend more time reading it and praying would be my advice.	1	4

Why doesn't the bible make any sense?	Have you asked the Author to help you understand?  If you read book (any book) and you don't understand it - then the best place to seek understanding would be to go to the Author himself.  God is the Author of the Bible, have you asked Him to give you understanding.  As for physical evidence, that's where Faith comes in!  I know the different books were written by different men of the Bible, but every single man was moved by ONE SPIRIT - GOD!  Ask the Author and see what happens!	0	2
Why doesn't the bible make any sense?	well let's say that the real thing is why don't you prove what you are saying is true which it's not It seems to me you have not researched the so called facts you state as you may have thought.   Parts of Noahs Ark have been sighted on Mount Ararat and bits of tarred gofer wood which the Ark was made from have been dated and found to be 5000 years old,this is proof that the bible is true, and there is more; Look at the Moabite Stone.The original can be seen in the Louvre Museum in Paris France. The writing tells of the rebellion of King Mesha of Moab against Israel. This  event is also reported in the Bible (2 Kings1:1:3:4-27) The Pool of Siloam and the entrance of a 1,749 foot  -long(533 meter-long)water tunnel in Jerusalem. Many modern-day visitors to Jerusalem have waded through this tunnel. It's existance is further proof that the Bible is true, The Bible explains that King Hezekiah had this tunnel built over2,500 years ago to protect his water supply from an invading army,-(2Kings20:20; 2Chronicles32:2-4,30)At the British Museum a visitor can see the Neabonidus Chronicle. It describes the fall of ancient Babylon, even as the Bible also does.(Daniel5:30,31)The Bible says that Belshazzar was then King of Babylon.  In fact, at one time all known writings said that Nabonidus was Babylon's last king. So some who said the Bible is not true claimed that Belshazzar never existed and that the Bible was wrong. But in recent years ancient writings have been found that identified Belshazzar as a son of Nabonidus and coruler with his father in Babylon at the time. Yes, the Bible really is true, as so many examples prove.Yet the Bible does not contain only true history.Everything it says is true, Even when it touches on matters of science, it is marvelously accurate. These are only some examples, but the more research you do the more you will see the truth of the Bible.	1	4
Why doesn't the bible make any sense?	"Many people feel the Bible contradicts itself...and I can sooo see why they think that. I was there at one time!. But, I got into a Bible study, where it was from beginning to end, and it was explained to me, and now I get it.. Unless a person is open to it w/ no judgement, and they are sincere in learning, not in disproving, God will open your spirit up to Him and HIs Word, and all will make sense.. Only those who seek it sincerely, and will find God, and only those who He reveals Himself to through His Word, will truly get it.. . Read 1 Cor 2:11-16:. ""For who among men knows the thoughts of a man except the man's spirit within him? In the same way no one knows the thoughts of God except the Spirit of God. We have not received the spirit of the world but the Spirit who is from God, that we may understand what God has freely given us. This is what we speak, not in words taught us by human wisdom but in words taught by the Spirit, expressing spiritual truths in spiritual words. The man without the Spirit does not accept the things that come from the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him, and he cannot understand them, because they are spiritually discerned. The spiritual man makes judgments about all things, but he himself is not subject to any man's judgment: . ""For who has known the mind of the Lord .  that he may instruct him?"" But we have the mind of Christ."". . I would reccomend if you really want to know answers and learn about Him either way, get yourself into a Bible study. . http://wec.upci.org/churches. . that will teach you the Word of God from beginning to end and you can make an educated decision on it for yourself.... But know one thing- God says in the Bible He does not want you to have ""religion"" (which is man made rules)... He wants you to have a relationship with Him! They are different and people often confuse the two."	1	4
Why doesn't the bible make any sense?	"Religion is based on FAITH. If you do not have faith, then you cannot subscribe to the belief. And just because one has faith that there is a God or a higher power, does not believe that they take the bible literally. I believe the bible is meant as a guidepost in our journey; it is not to be taken as absolute truth, becuase you're right, there are many disagreeing passages. This is why extreme Christians are often accused of ""picking and choosing"" which passages they want to follow, it is impossible to follow all of them!. . As for why you should believe... is it better to believe and be wrong or to not believe and be wrong? If you are serious about finding faith, do some research about the various religions, try the test at www.beliefnet.com , and find a local minister to talk to."	1	3

Why doesn't the bible make any sense?	it is a nonsense written many years ago that got even worst with all the translation it went thru...ofcourse it makes no sense.	1	3
Why doesn't the bible make any sense?	You have to remember that the bible was written after Jesus died and that it was written by different people, so many things can not make much sense. The important thinf is, to believe in God and love everyone with respect.	1	4
Why doesn't the bible make any sense?	"Try the excellent book ""Who Wrote the Bible"" by Richard Friedman. It is an excellent, scholarly study of the major authors of the Hebrew Scriptures (what Christians call the old testament), how their texts were interwoven, and the beauty that arises out of these multiple sources that is greater than the sum of its parts.. . There is an excellent companion called ""The Bible with Sources Revealed"" that has each author in a different typeface/color for easier reading - tremendously illuminating!"	1	4
Why doesn't the bible make any sense?	Just so you know, before the Great Flood, there was no such thing as rain.  The earth was fed from the ground up and did not need precipitation.  So when the flood receded, it did like it would if you had a flood today.	0	1
Why doesn't the bible make any sense?	"That is certainly more than one question.  To answer your first question: the Bible does make sense, and it is harmonious from cover to cover.  The problem arises when people try to force the Bible to fit their beliefs, instead of adjusting their beliefs to agree with Bible teachings.  For example, some want to say that the Bible says nothing about homosexuality because that fits their desires.  However, the Bible does indeed speak on the subject, and is consistent throughout.  When a person's beliefs go contrary to Bible teachings, what should he or she do?  Trust the Bible.. . Now, as to physical evidence...archaeologists have indeed found evidence as stated in the Bible.  In fact, there are things in the Bible that archaelogists and other scientists doubted...until they found it.  Whether it is the city of Ninevah, or certain kings stated in the Bible, to wells and other locales, the Bible has been found to be accurate.. . Your statement about evolution doesn't really hold water.  Even though bones and fossils have been found, even Darwin admitted that his theory has so many holes in it that it couldn't stand up to intense scrutiny.  The problem is that scientists refuse to apply scientific principles to their theory.  If a scientist finds data that contradicts a hypothesis, then by rights the scientist must discard the hypothesis and formulate a new one based on the new data.  However, with evolution, they refuse to discard it and instead try to force the data to fit the hypothesis.  In a way, evolution is their faith, rather than a science.. . Thus, instead of believing in ""religion"", trust in the Bible and speak with those who live their lives according to its principles, and those who are students of its teachings, rather than students of the philosophies of men."	1	3
Why doesn't the bible make any sense?	If you don't want to, then you shouldn't. Make your own decisions regarding religion. Choose which one you think is right, or if you believe in any of them at all, and just run with it.	0	2
Why doesn't the bible make any sense?	I believe in God and in Jesus very much.But the reason why the Bible makes no sense is because they have been chopping off information,and some other facts were lost in the succesives translations.. We´re not really to know the real deal, yet.	1	3
Why doesn't the bible make any sense?	"Making sense it not the name of the game.""I'm-right-you're-wrong-. that settles it""is.People believe what casts THEM in agood light,facts be damned.Everyone says. what they want to be true.Always have."	0	2

Why doesn't the bible make any sense?	If there's make any sense then there will be no faith.	0	2
Why doesn't the bible make any sense?	"The Bible makes perfect sense.  You have to put the passages in context with the other books of the Bible.  As far as ""magical things that don't exist"", I've seen a kid that drowned and didn't draw a breath for 8 minutes.  That was around five, by 7:30 they were readying the life flight to carry him to a better hospital.  After much prayer by 9:30 he was coming too.  By 8:00 A.M. the nurses were begging the doctors to send him home (he was a rambunctious kid).  This is one of many and there is more to the story.  As far a the fossils record, did you know that the textbooks use a chart to show evolution in the dinosaurs but if you check the dates that the dinos existed they are out of order in the progression chart.  Evolution cannot explain the fact that in the fossil record species disappear and new ones appear with no intermediate species.  I could go on, but I will not bore you."	1	4
Why doesn't the bible make any sense?	"Because it's just a book written by goatherders (old testament) and cult followers (new testament) who didn't even make sense when they were alive. For some reason people take it really seriously though.. . PS: And how can ""the Bible"" be completely true from cover to cover when there are so many different translations. Which one is the one that is completely true? What happens to the gospel when two versions contradict each other? How can it be ""the Gospel"" when some versions are considered out of date? Does the truth change?"	1	3

Why doesn't the bible make any sense?	you shouldnt believe it think freely. also its just a bunch of campfire stories put together into a book trying to explain the unknown to unscientific minds.	0	2
Why doesn't the bible make any sense?	care to give a specific example?. . where does one passage totally disagree with another?. . and don't use your justification for disagreeing as a lack of physical evidence. . we actually lack the physical evidence that dinosaurs were ever alive (think about it, all we have are bones, that's not evidence that they were alive), we lack evidence that we evolved from monkeys (think about it, we have no eye-witness accounts) and we lack physical evidence for wind (you can't see wind, you only see the results from wind--moving trees, things falling over, moving clouds--wind is moving air which is invisible). . before you question a faith or a belief system that is centered on a metaphysical point...consider questioning any system of belief built upon the collective data of persons that are dead with observations that are justifiable only by collective agreement.	1	3

Why doesn't the bible make any sense?	I just read a book by A. L. De Silva that addresses this. It is written by a Buddhist and may seem a bit controversial. First, because it gives much evidence to invalidate the Bible and Christianity. And second, because it is not in the Buddhist tradition to debunk other religions. That aside, it does make some very valid points that can be proven. Sorry if this offends anyone, that is not my intention only healthy debate.	0	2

Why doesn't the bible make any sense?	The bible is actually a record of conversations between someone in today's time with God before the time of even Isreal.  many people eaves dropped through what is called the deceiver (the catholic church plays a roll) We don't come from paradise we are heading toward's it.	0	2
Why doesn't the bible make any sense?	BIBLE IS WRITTEN IN MYSTERY... Mystery is revealed only to those who are elected... if anyone thinks it does not makes sense, it is because he is not chosen to know the meaning of the bible..	0	2
Why doesn't the bible make any sense?	The Bible makes perfect sense if you understand the reason it was written.  It was not just one man sitting down and saying, I'm going to write this and everyone will believe me.  Every book in the Bible was written by a different person, and some were written by several people together.  Hense the names of the books.  e.g.the book of John, Peter, Galatians...They were named after the people that wrote them.  And since no one has exactly the same outlook on things as another person, all the details aren't exactly the same.  Let's say you and I were watching Jesus's crucifiction.  You're at the front of the crowd, throwing stones, and I'm at the back praying for Him to leave this world and join His Father.  From where you're standing, it looks one way.  But it's different where I'm at.  In the end, the simple fact is, He was still nailed to a cross and burned, along with two other men.  . . You also have to think about the language barrier.  You and I may speak English, and read our Bibles in English.  But the first Bibles were not written that way.  Every book in the Bible was written by a different person, from a different region of the world.  So, the Bible you know today has been translated and retranslated so many times, some of the words are not what they ere originally.  . . You can't expect the Bible to conform to how you think.  It was written thousands of years ago.  Things change over time.  But instead, try to put yourself in the mode of thinking that those people were in when they wrote it.  All they knew was what they saw, heard, felt, and experienced for them selves.  Than they wrote it down.  Just the same as celebrities and athletes do now.  You just have to look at it through a different pair of eyes for a little while.  Then you'll understand it.	1	4
Why doesn't the bible make any sense?	"You can't make sense because you only read a passage.  It does make sense, it is Truth.  There are many proofs of things mentioned in the Bible. There is nothing ""magical"", it is the Holy Bible not Harry Potter, There are iracles.. Don't just  look here and there, read complete chapters.  That's how you begin to see the thread.  Even though there were many writers I believe the Bible is the inspired word of God.  When you really get into it you will see it's not contradictory at all.  Ask Him to show you the Truth.  I read five Psalms every day and one chapter in Proverbs.  I read other books of the Bible too but that's my way and Ithink I've learned a lot.  Don't know if you were honestly looking for an answer or just wanting to rile some Christians, but I hope I've helped."	1	3

Why doesn't the bible make any sense?	I have always heard that there is one verse that claims, the truth in the Bible is repeated 2 times or more because it was witnessed by 2 or more.  Example - the way that Judah died...  Have you tried praying before you read the Bible, and did it occur to you that you can only understand what you are ready to understand...If God doesn't want you to understand it, or if you don't wanna, then you won't.  It's as simple as that.	1	3

Why doesn't the bible make any sense?	The Bible doesn't make sense to you perhaps because you don't have a standard modern version (are you reading a King James version? That doesn't make sense) and because it was written SO long ago. They talked differently then and that is how is was written down. . . Evolution isn't real. So animals are similar. So are other things. That doesn't mean they're related. Like a tree and my hair: both brown, so what? Not related!. . You should believe the Bible because God speaks through it and it is completely cover-to-cover true.	1	4

Why doesn't the bible make any sense?	It's a disgusting perversion of a wonderful concept: love. It goes against nature for humans of the opposite sex to engage in a sexual relationship.

what are mormens?	For other uses, see Mormon (disambiguation).. Mormon is a colloquial term used to refer to adherents of the Latter Day Saint movement, and most commonly to the movement's original and largest group, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. The term is derived from The Book of Mormon, which Joseph Smith claims to have translated from ancient plates containing a history of the early inhabitants of the Americas that was compiled by a prophet called Mormon. Some mainstream Christian groups consider Mormonism as a cult.	1	4

what are mormens?	"References: Mormon vs Biblical Teachings about Salvation . . . Bible quotations are from the New American Standard version. For information on sources of Mormon quotations, see the section titled ""Mormon Documents"".. . . . 1. Mormons teach that salvation (exaltation) comes through faith in Christ plus baptism plus works, i.e., we must add to the work of Christ. In the Bible 'salvation' means deliverance from the consequence (eternal separation from God) of our sin. Mormon leaders have redefined the word 'salvation' to have a two-fold meaning: a) forgiveness of sins and b) universal resurrection:. . ""There will be a General Salvation for all in the sense in which that term is generally used, but salvation, meaning resurrection, is not exaltation"" (Stephen L. Richards, Contributions of Joseph Smith, LDS tract, p.5). . ""All men are saved by grace alone without any act on their part, meaning they are resurrected"" (Bruce McConkie, What Mormons Think of Christ"", LDS tract, p.28). . Thus, when a Mormon speaks of 'salvation by grace', he is usually referring to universal resurrection. Mormons use the term 'exaltation' to refer to attain a place in the highest level of heaven. The Mormon term 'exaltation' is more nearly equivalent to the Biblical term 'salvation'. What do Mormon leaders say about this?. . The Book of Mormon says of salvation: ""for we know that is is by grace that we are saved, after all that we can do"" (Book of Mormon, 2 Nephi 25:23). . The LDS Third Article of Faith states: ""We believe that through the Atonement of Christ, all mankind may be saved, by obedience to the laws and ordinances of the gospel"" (Pearl of Great Price: Articles of Faith). . Joseph Fielding Smith explains what that last phrase means: ""that which man merits through his own acts through life and by obedience to the laws and ordinances of the gospel"" (Doctrines of Salvation, vol. 1, p.134). . James Talmage explains: ""...redemption from personal sins can only be obtained through obedience to the requirement of the Gospel, and a life of good works"" (James Talmage, in A Study of the Articles of Faith). . Spencer W. Kimball states: ""however powerful the saving grace of Christ, it brings exaltation to no man who does not comply with the works of the gospel"" (The Miracle of Forgiveness, pg. 207); ""Each command we obey sends us another rung up the ladder to perfected manhood and toward godhood; and every law disobeyed is a sliding toward the bottom where man merges into the brute world"" (Teachings of Spencer W. Kimball, pg. 153); ""living all the commandments guarantees total forgiveness of sins and assures one of exaltation...trying is not sufficient. Nor is repentence when one merely tries to abandon sin"" (The Miracle of Forgiveness, p.164-165, 354-355). . Bruce McConkie claimed: ""Jesus kept the commandments of his Father and thereby worked out his own salvation, and also set an example as to the way and the means whereby all men may be saved"" (The Mortal Messiah, Vol.4, p.434). . What works do they mean? Here are some:. . Baptism for the dead: ""The greatest responsibility in this world that God has laid upon us is to seek after our dead...Those saints who neglect it in behalf of their deceased relatives, do it at peril of their own salvation"" (Joseph Smith, in Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith, p.356, 196). . Marriages sealed in the Temple: ""Marriage is not only a righteous institution, but obedience to this law [Temple marriage] is absolutely necessary in order to obtain the highest exaltation in the Kingdom of God"" (Milton R. Hunter, in Gospel Through the Ages, p.119). . Keeping the whole law: ""To enter the celestial [kingdom] and obtain exaltation, it is necessary that the whole law be kept...Do you desire to enter the celestial Kingdom and receive eternal life?

If you don't take antibiotics however, you run the risk of getting rheumatic fever which can cause damage to the valves inside your heart.  Chances are low, but definitely greater if you don't treat the strep throat.  If it were me, I would go see a doctor.. . A similar question was asked recently:. http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AiYkU1pXAqVWPU3fgPanNKfsy6IX?qid=1006060217410. . Oh yeah, about the bleach water gargle.  It will probably kill whatever bacteria it comes in contact it.  It will probably also severely irritate your throat.  There's a reason people use other things like hydrogen peroxide, salt water, or alcohol-based mouthwashes.	1	3
what are the symptoms of strep throat?	"initial symptoms of ""mono"" are:. . a general lack of energy or malaise, . a loss of appetite, and . chills. . These initial symptoms can last from one to three days before the more intense symptoms of the illness begin. The more common intense symptoms include:. . a severe sore throat, . fever, and . swollen glands (lymph nodes) in the neck area. . It is generally the severe sore throat that prompts people to contact their doctor. . . What are the signs of ""mono?"" . . In addition to a fever from 102 to 104 degrees Fahrenheit, the most common signs of ""mono"" are:. . a very reddened throat and tonsils and . swollen lymph glands in the neck. . The tonsils have a whitish coating in at least one third of the cases. The spleen, (sometimes referred to as the body's biggest lymph node), is an organ found in the left upper abdomen underneath the ribcage which becomes enlarged or swollen in about 50% of patients with ""mono."" An enlarged liver may also occur. About 5% of patients have a splotchy red rash over the body, which has a similar appearance to the rash of measles. . . How is ""mono"" diagnosed? . . The diagnosis of ""mono"" is suspected by the doctor based on the above symptoms and signs. ""Mono"" is confirmed by blood tests while testing to exclude other possible causes of the symptoms. Early in the course of the illness, blood tests show an increase in a type of white blood cell (lymphocyte). Some of these increased lymphocytes are unusual or ""atypical"" lymphocytes, which suggest ""mono."" More specific testing, such as the monospot and heterophile antibody tests, can confirm the diagnosis of ""mono."" These tests rely on the body's immune system to make measurable antibodies against the EBV. Unfortunately, the antibodies may not become detectable until the second or third weeks of the illness. A blood chemistry test can reveal abnormalities in liver function. Testing to exclude the possibility of a strep throat is also considered for some patients."	0	1

what are the symptoms of strep throat?	(m). . Strep throat is an infection caused by group A streptococcus bacteria, and it's very common among kids and teens. The symptoms of strep throat include fever, stomach pain, and red, swollen tonsils.. . Strep throat usually requires treatment with antibiotics. With the proper medical care - along with plenty of rest and fluids - your child should be back to school and play within a few days.. . Diagnosing Strep Throat . If your child's throat is sore and he or she has other strep throat symptoms, it's a good idea to call your child's doctor. The doctor will likely do a rapid strep test in the office, using a cotton swab to take a sample of the fluids at the back of your child's throat. The test only takes about 5 minutes. If it's positive, your child has strep throat. If the test is negative, the doctor will send a sample to a lab for a throat culture. The results are usually available within a few days.. . Treating Strep Throat. In most cases, doctors prescribe about 10 days of antibiotic medication to treat strep throat. Within about 24 hours after your child starts taking the antibiotics, his or her temperature will probably be back to normal, and your child will no longer be contagious. By the second or third day after taking antibiotics, the other symptoms should start to go away, too. . . Even though your child may not feel sick at that point, it's very important that he or she finish the antibiotic prescription. If your child stops taking antibiotics too soon, bacteria can remain in the throat and the symptoms can return.. . If your child is not treated for strep throat, he or she is most infectious when the symptoms are the most severe but could remain contagious for up to 21 days. Lack of treatment - or not finishing the prescribed course of antibiotics - also could put your child at risk for other health problems, such as rheumatic fever (which can cause permanent damage to the heart), scarlet fever, blood infections, or kidney disease.. . To prevent your sick child from spreading strep throat to others in your home, keep his or her eating utensils, dishes, and drinking glasses separate from those that everyone else is using. Wash them in hot, soapy water after each use. Also, make sure your child doesn't share food, drinks, napkins, handkerchiefs, or towels with other family members. Make sure your child covers his or her mouth and nose during a sneeze or a cough to prevent passing infectious fluid droplets to someone else.. . Caring for Your Child With Strep Throat. There's plenty you can do to help your child feel better. To prevent dehydration, make sure your child drinks plenty of cool liquids, such as water or ginger ale, especially if he or she has had a fever. Avoid orange juice, grapefruit juice, lemonade, or other acidic beverages, which may irritate your child's throat. Warm liquids like soups, tea with honey, or hot chocolate can be soothing.. . As your child starts to feel better, talk to your child's doctor about the best time to return to school and other routine activities.	1	4

Why  is  the   war continuing  in  Afghanistan?	Because the Democrats have convinced a large portion of the American people that the Iraq war is a mistake, entered on false intelligence and that it took the concentration off of Afghanistan. they don't bother to tell the people that they saw the same intelligence and voted for the war they want all the blame to go to the Republicans. After 9/11 people were ready to go to war in Afghanistan but are not capable of comprehending that Iraq is a very important front in the war on terror.	1	3

Why  is  the   war continuing  in  Afghanistan?	War can only be declared on a recognized country.  Since Al-Qaeda is not a country, we have not done that.  We did declare war on Afghanistan when the Taliban were there and supporting Al-Qaeda.  We won and Taliban has been pushed out of power in Afghanistan.	1	3
Why  is  the   war continuing  in  Afghanistan?	Remember the man that killed all the Americans - he and his buddies are still running around in Afghanistan and Iraq and several other countries that we have not gotten around to yet.

Why  is  the   war continuing  in  Afghanistan?	The Iraq war was planned by Cheney and Rumsfeld and Wolfowitz during the Clinton Administration. In fact they tried to get Clinton to invade. It was, and is, and will be about the oil. If you want to look at the success rate of our GWOT, just take a look at Afghanistan. The Taliban is now running 1/3 of the country almost with impunity. And the Afghan peoples are welcoming them back. We didn't finish a damn thing we set out to do in Afghanistan and now it's coming back on us. Look at Somalia. Islamic Extremists are threatening to overthrow the government there. . . This is a new type of war. A war that can't be fought by guns and bombs and invasions. This is a war about peoples well being. Why have the Taliban made such strong strides in Afghanistan? Because they're bringing stability to the region. They bring the rule of law. . . If you look at the statistics for the places where extremism is on the rise, you can see that those places are very insular and have high rates of unemployment. These people have nothing better to do and have families to support. A lot of it isn't about idealogy. It's simple economics. And THAT is where we need to fight this war.. . And for those of you that say it was us liberals that tied Saddam and Al Qaeda together, please go back on listen to what YOUR president said. It was the Administration that implied that they were linked.	1	3
Why  is  the   war continuing  in  Afghanistan?	I do think that Iraq was to take the attention away from Afghanistan, seems both have taken some hits. the most important thing is not the wars per say but to support our sailors, and ground troops who do the mucking.. only time will tell, as even the civil war was to last for 100 years. Take care and bless a troop.	0	2
Why  is  the   war continuing  in  Afghanistan?	The Bush administration (Not We) are at war because when republicans are president they take the country to war. The Bush administration (Not We) may kill everyone in Iraq if they continue to hinder the true goal of the invasion, looting all of Iraq's oil.	1	3
Why  is  the   war continuing  in  Afghanistan?	The war was supposedly started because there were weapons of mass destruction stockpiled by Saddam Hussein.  When that turned out to be untrue, the reason for the war somehow morphed into a crusade to establish democracy in Iraq.  Bush continues to try to link Iraq to the 9/11 attacks, even though it is clear that Iraq was never involved.  In short, the war was based on a lie and the lies keep accumulating.  Thousands of people are now dead because George Bush was too arrogant to admit his errors and stop this thing.	0	2
Why  is  the   war continuing  in  Afghanistan?	"USA might as well clean up its messes.. . Check history..I attached links.. do the reading. . -US Govt was instrumental in the backing of Saddams rise as a leader.(old cold war politics US backs a candidate USSR backs one)Guess who US backed? 1979  Study how Saddams Predecessor: Abd ar-Rahman Arif left office. . -More cold war Politics When USSR invaded Afgahnistan..US was instrumental in the backing of Ben Ladin...against  The Soviet invasion of Afghanistan resulted in a call to arms by religious leaders all over the Muslim world to liberate the country from pro-Soviet rule. Bin Laden eagerly sent money, supplies, and weapons to the jihadis in Afghanistan.. . -More Cold War Politics- Afghanistan... hey USA was instrumental in backing the very same people (Taliban ) that the US just had to go back & chase out of power there a few years ago. . Afghanistan exists at a unique nexus-point where numerous Eurasian civilizations have interacted and often fought and was an important site of early historical activity. Through the ages, the region today known as Afghanistan has been invaded by a host of peoples, including the Aryans, Medes, Persians, Greeks, Mauryans, Kushans, Sassanians, Arabs, Turks, British, and Soviets, but rarely have these groups managed to exert complete control over the region.. . Even when US was not physically present, the bullets and weapons were present and shell casings which said ""Made in USA"". . I was shocked when I read it in black & white too.. . I like to think that the US is just doing the right thing too.  I realize that countries administrations act in their country's perceived best interest, which may or may not be perceived as doing the right thing.  During the cold war it was most likely the right thing.  Years later it was like frankenstiens monster.. It had to be cleaned up.  A great evil may have been removed for the greater good of all and for the US.  In 40 years when the new administrations which we just placed in power have become old they may be the monsters.  US may have to go clean up again.. .  If we do not learn from history we are doomed to repeat."	1	4
Why  is  the   war continuing  in  Afghanistan?	I think it's kind of gone into a bad light. Although our punishment of bombing Afghanistan fit the crime (in my opinion), as time goes on people do forget what we were trying to accomplish there. And the war in Iraq (which I do not support nor condemn) is taking precedence over what our true cause was.	1	3
Why  is  the   war continuing  in  Afghanistan?	as a liberal, i am concerned about the national debt because first of all there wasn't one going into the Bush administration. Second, i don't agree with spending $150 billion dollars a year on a war for oil rather than spending it on improving education which is in desparate need of a reform. And I do not agree with spending any money to kill or have people killed as we are doing in the war in Afghanistan, Iraq, and now our reconissance troops in Iran. As far as sources go, you can find them on your own. I dont need to do your research for you.	0	2
Why  is  the   war continuing  in  Afghanistan?	The Taliban only opperates in Afghanistan and parts of Pakistan, whereas al-Qaeda opperates globally. Tactically, one of the differences between the two organisations is that the Taliban is prepared to fight conventional battles, whereas al-Qaeda only uses terrorism to fight its wars.	1	4
Why  is  the   war continuing  in  Afghanistan?	well in case of pearl harbour the attacker was imperial japanese force on the pacific island of HAWAII.. the reason of attack was Americans coverted support to allied forces in second world war.. . in case of september 11 attack was conducted by the al-qaida terrosists promoted by osama bin laden, on the atlantic cities of NEW YORK, WASHINGTON DC.. the reason of attack was American airstrikes attack on afghanistans taliban regime.	1	4
Why  is  the   war continuing  in  Afghanistan?	"Afghanistan is, and was, supposed to be a light touch war to assist the Afghans themselves to overthrow the Taleban.. . For once the west were sensitive to the fact that Afghans have been killing each other cheerfully for 500 years but the only thing that has ever united them is a foreign invader (Persians, Indians, British, Russians etc).. . They all stop fighting each other for a while, beat the invader, and then go back to killing each other. Its just they way they are and always have been.. . Therefore the idea is that the US and Brit forces over there are transitional into a NATO force, and eventually U.N force to ""assist"" the new government with security. Not to prosecute a war.. . Iraq is similar, but with the added subtelty that it is acting as a magnet for anti western lunatics everywhere to come and have a crack at the U.S and her allies.. . What I believe the strategy is, is that the allies are allowing this to happen as the current rate of attrition is 70 - 100 insurgents killed for every allied soldier killed or wounded.. . In any war that is an acceptable battlefield ratio and one where the west is winning. Also for every nutter who goes to Iraq and runs at a tank with an AK47 there is one less suicide bomber to go on the subway in New York."	1	3
Why  is  the   war continuing  in  Afghanistan?	America is at war because it is thinking long term for the benefit of America. Owning a land such as Iraq will have immense financial profits or savings for America during oil shortage which will come some time soon and America just is preparing in advance for it. Expect it to attack Iran too if it can.. This is also the reason that it attacked Afghanistan to start the oil pipeline it wanted to pass through Afghanistan to the sea for shipping of oil.	1	4
Why  is  the   war continuing  in  Afghanistan?	There aren't car bombs going off and US servicemen paying the ultimate sacrifice every day in Afghanistan. Bad news sells. Plus, even the liberal media knows Afghanistan was necessary, they just don't see Iraq in the same light.	1	4
Why  is  the   war continuing  in  Afghanistan?	ok, wow...where do i start...what does the war on Afghanistan have to do with it? Whenever 9/11 happened it was justified by MANY Muslim countries to go into Afghanistan, guess they wanted to eliminate their own religion. No, as no one wants to eliminate all of the Muslims.. . On the war on Iraq, yes this clearly proves what? I don't particularly agree with this war, however, this being said their is no mass killings of Muslims. If im not mistaken its the insurgency that is trying to cause sectarian violence against their own people. Its extremest that want you to believe this crap about all western countries want to destroy all the Muslims which is a horrible lie, that you somehow believe. . . As for the part about the Western world wanting Muslim blood. Believe it or not its a lie. Just get over yourself and stop blammoing all of the western world for everything thing that goes wrong. The US hasn't went and executed millions of people like Husein did, and we won't.. . This one I love the most, about the Israelis  controlling all of the US. I mean I don't see how we covered it up for so long. If you honestly think this was the case don't you think we would've unsupported other Muslim countries?	0	2
Why  is  the   war continuing  in  Afghanistan?	When the press turns against the war with a constant drone of peace at any cost the population will give in.. . Afghanistan is going to need more than the drug addiction of the 1st World to base their economy on.	0	1
Why  is  the   war continuing  in  Afghanistan?	It was the inadequate intelligence gathering of the U.S.Secret Service and the presumed ownership of weapons of Mass Destruction that MADE this ILLEGAL WAR take place.This PRICE for DEMOCRACY is VERY inconsequential to the LIVES that were lost and will continue to be lost THEIR in IRAQ.	0	2
Why  is  the   war continuing  in  Afghanistan?	According to unverified informations, there is a Document called 'Protocals', perhaps of ZionistChristians andJews. Their long term planning was stated to be  defacing all Muslim countries by 1910, in order to let 'prophesies' fulfill! So one and the other excuse was coined to attack and subdue one by one all the countries with some Musliminfluence. Apparently now,  Iraq had no weapons of mass destruction, and Afghans had no means to attack any western country. Yet the war goes on. The cause may be religious, not oil. No oil in Afghanistan. However this answer is based on hearsay,on conjectures. May be a food for thoughts!	1	3
Why  is  the   war continuing  in  Afghanistan?	"Why do liberals persist in claiming that Bush lied?. . Since the end of hostilities in the 1991 Gulf War (ie, the one that started with Iraq's invasion of Kuwait), Saddam repeatedly violated the terms of the cease fire.  He routinely fired Surface to Air missiles on allied aircraft patrolling the no-fly zones (established to halt his crackdown on opposition Shiites).  I don't think you will find many conservatives alleging that Iraq attacked us on 9-11, but Iraq's continuing violation of the cease fire terms and failure to abide by UN resolutions led to the war.  In addition, Iraq harbored terrorists escaping from the fall of the Taliban in Afghanistan, paid ""commissions"" to the families of Palestinian suicide bombers in Israel, and met with terrorist organizations including al-quaeda on numerous occasions before we invaded Iraq."	0	1
Why  is  the   war continuing  in  Afghanistan?	You know actually, I was waiting for something like that to happen sooner or later. Canadians are involved in Afghanistan after all.	0	2

what are some signs that puberty is beginning?	I'm going to assume that you mean puberty. Puberty is a fairly short period of time that signals the onset of adolesence, when the body starts releasing certain hormones that are associated with sexual maturity. Late puberty in humans (relative to other animals) allows us to become more socially integrated without the dangers of childbearing at, say, age 10. Basically if puberty did not exist, the assumption would be that we were sexually mature our entire lives, from birth until fertility drops or death.	1	4
what are some signs that puberty is beginning?	"Ending?????  Never heard that question before.. . There is probably MANY things or maybe NONE to indicate puberty is ending.   Once your enter into puberty, your body is preparing for adult life.  I don't think it EVER ends!!!. . How can it end?  . . Lets take a man.  His voice deepens.  He grows whiskers, with more hair including pubic hair.  He will begin to think of sex and girls.  He become a lot more mature and his think is usually better than when he was a ""kid"".  I think puberty lasts until death for men.. . Lets take a woman:  She begans to grow breasts, pubic hair, have periods and her figure becomes more pronounced.  She begins to think of sex and reproduction.  She will remain this way until menopause when her periods end as does her child bearing.  IF she survives menopause....nothing else will change except she will age.. . So I think puberty is the beginning of the maturity of a man and/or woman.   Good luck.  Pops"	1	3

what are some signs that puberty is beginning?	puberty , period during which the onset of sexual maturity occurs. It usually takes place between the ages of 10 and 15 in both sexes but sometimes occurs as early as 7 or 8 years of age in females. The pituitary gland secretes hormones that stimulate enlargement and development of the sex organs, which thus become capable of reproduction. The appearance of secondary sex characteristics also occurs during puberty. In females the reproductive cycle of ovulation and menstruation begins, pubic hair appears, and development of the breasts and other body contours takes place. Physical changes in males include production and discharge of semen, appearance of facial and body hair, and deepening of the voice. Skin difficulties, such as acne, may affect both sexes. Puberty, a transition period coinciding with adolescence, involves both physiological and psychological adjustments. It is often marked by emotional stress arising as the adolescent relinquishes childhood behavior patterns and adopts those of an adult.. . AND BOYS DO NOT HAVE PUBERTY BECAUSE ONLY GIRLS DOES	1	3

Why do men fantasized about raping women?	control	1	3
Why do men fantasized about raping women?	"Rape is about power not sex. This is the first misconception about rape. It is about dominance and control. Men rape women, and other men, and children. Women can rape, but statistics are not very high. Rape does not have to be anal or vaginal penetration, it can be oral and any behaviour in which the survivor of the rape did not consent to. This means that rape can and does happen in marriage. Women are more likely to be raped by people they know, as opposed to strangers.. Rape is about power, not sex. A rapist uses actual force or violence - or the threat of it - to take control over another human being. Some rapists use drugs to take away a person's ability to fight back. Rape is a crime, whether the person committing it is a stranger, a date, an acquaintance, or a family member.. . No matter how it happened, rape is frightening and traumatizing. People who have been raped need care, comfort, and a way to heal.. . Why Does it Happen?. . Let's look at sexual stereotyping and how males and females talk to each other. . . Although things are changing, society still frequently encourages men to be competitive and aggressive and teaches women to be passive and avoid confrontation. . Men say they misunderstand a woman's words and actions — the excuse ""she said no, but meant yes."" . Some people — men and women alike — still believe that it's okay for a man to demand sex if he takes a woman out or buys her gifts, and that it's not rape if he forces sex on a woman who previously had sex with him or other men. . Women also feel that if they've previously had sex with their boyfriend and he later forces her to have sex against her will, it may not be considered rape. . . Date rape can happen in homosexual relationships as well as heterosexual ones. Although it is less frequent, men can also be the victim of rape. It is still a crime and the victim still needs to get medical attention and counseling as soon as possible.. . Rape is the sexual expression of. hostility and aggression - a behavioral act not a psychiatric. condition. Rape typically reflects deep seated feelings of. inadequacy. . . Men rape because they believe they have the right to control and to punish women who do not obey their rules of behaviour. Rape is an expression of unequal power relations between men and women. Such unequal power relations are not the result of nature or evolution but societies which, through legislation and social custom, have made women second-class citizens.. . .  In our culture sex is so interfused with violence that powerlessness and power themselves have become eroticized. Getting at the real motives of rapists is difficult since they typically do not admit their crimes. Experts say rapists are notoriously manipulative and don't always tell the truth."	0	2
Why do men fantasized about raping women?	This is the fantasy of very few men.  And then usually only short-term for them.. Never hesitate to ask to be escorted to your car, et cetera.

Why do men fantasized about raping women?	Men are more visually stimulated than women.. That is why men's porn sells as videotapes and magazines while women buy more romance novels to fantasize. . .

So this proliferation of stimulus encourages more such response from men, creating the impression that is all they respond to.	1	3

Why do men fantasized about raping women?	Because women are not equally represented in any government in the world and until they understand that and people (men and women both) decide to do something about it there will always be an unbalance and therefore a struggle for power and control amongst men.  Women have an ability to balance things that men have always fought each other over; land, money, hunting grounds, women, etc.  About that, if men would start realizing that women are not property to be fought over, traded, raped and bought, there would be a heck of a lot less to fight each other about. Except maybe who gets the last beer in the case.	1	3
Why do men fantasized about raping women?	Men who rape are sick and demented. The only way they can feel good and powerful about their self is to hurt and degrade people who they feel are weaker then their self's. Rape is not in most cases about sex.

With a mass of about 1.5 times that of the Milky Way, it is the dominant galaxy of the Local Group, which consists of about 30 small galaxies plus three large spirals: Andromeda, Milky Way and M33. (With improving measurements and data, some scientists now believe that the Milky Way contains more dark matter and may be more massive than M31.)	1	4

what is the term milky way?	Milky Way, the galaxy of which the sun and solar system are a part, seen as a broad band of light arching across the night sky from horizon to horizon; if not blocked by the horizon, it would be seen as a circle around the entire sky. Although its motion is not readily apparent, the entire galaxy is rotating about the Milky Way's center. Relative to the universe, the galaxy is moving at a speed of c.370 mi per sec (c.590 km per sec) in the same direction that the constellation Leo lies relative to the earth; it is also moving at c.60 mi per sec (c.100 km per sec) relative to the center of mass of the local group of galaxies. The sun, traveling at a speed of c.150 mi per sec (c.240 km per sec) in a nearly circular orbit, takes 200–230 million years to complete one revolution.. Visual Characteristics of the Milky Way. . Among the constellations the Milky Way passes through are Carina, Crux (the Southern Cross), Sagittarius (where it is brightest), Scorpius, Aquila, Cygnus, Perseus, Cassiopeia, Auriga, and Gemini. In the direction of Cygnus is the Great Rift, a band of dark matter that lies along the Milky Way, dividing it into two forks. Another dark region is the Coalsack, in Crux. Once believed to be vast empty regions in space, these dark areas are now known to be clouds of dark matter blotting out the light behind them. Such nonluminous clouds of dust and gas, called dark nebulae, obscure many parts of the sky from sight; in the direction of the galactic center, the view is almost entirely obscured.. . Size and Shape of the Milky Way. . The Milky Way is a large galaxy comprising an estimated 200 billion stars (some estimates range as high as 400 billion) arrayed in the form of a disk, with a central elliptical bulge (some 12,000 light-years in diameter) of closely packed stars lying in the direction of Sagittarius. It is surrounded by a flat disk marked by six spiral arms—four major and two minor—which wind out from the nucleus like a giant pinwheel. Because of these arms, the Milky Way was classified as a spiral galaxy. However, increasing evidence indicates that the Milky Way probably has a bar or barlike structure of new, bright stars in its central region. This would modify its classification to a barred spiral or an intermediate type between barred and “normal” spiral. Our sun is situated in one of the smaller arms, called the Local or Orion Arm, that connect the more substantial next inner arm and the next outer arm. The sun lies roughly two thirds of the way from the center of the disk, which is some 28,000 light-years distant, and in the galactic plane. When we look in the plane of the disk we see the combined light of its stars as the Milky Way. The diameter of the disk is c.100,000 light-years; its average thickness is 10,000 light-years, increasing to 30,000 light-years at the nucleus.. . Certain features of the region near the sun suggested that our galaxy resembles the Andromeda Galaxy. In 1951 a group led by William Morgan detected evidence of spiral arms in Orion and Perseus. Another bright arm stretches from Sagittarius to Carina in the southern sky. With the development of radio astronomy, scientists have extended a nearly complete map of the spiral structure of the galaxy by tracing regions of hydrogen that dominate the spiral arms.. . Surrounding the galaxy is a large spherical halo of globular star clusters that extends to a diameter of about 130,000 light-years; this is called the stellar halo. The galaxy also has a vast outer spherical region called the corona, or dark halo, which is as much as 600,000 light years in diameter and, in addition to dark matter which accounts for most of the Milky Way's mass, includes some distant globular clusters, the two nearby galaxies called the Magellanic clouds, and four smaller galaxies.. . Stellar Populations and Galactic Evolution. . The stars, gas, and dust that make up the Milky Way can be grouped into two broad stellar populations that suggest	1	4

why do some people take life so seriously?	I think that if people did lighten up and stop trying to spread the gospel (instead tried to live as an example to it) then the world would be a better place. Every time I try to smile here someone shuts it by shoving God down my throat. I love God, God loves me, end of.. .

why do some people take life so seriously?	"Well, truth be told, all the works of man, all that we do, is ""dust in the wind."" Sorry to quote an old song but it is true. So in the grand scheme of things we shouldn't be so serious all the time...yet for our brief moments on this earth so many suffer that it becomes necessary to be serious. So within the scope of a few years time we need to be serious and take the hardship of man seriously. Life appears to be the cheapest commodity on earth. For every soul lost there are a dozen more souls to take its place. So should we care? Should we be serious about all those strangers a thousand miles away who are not related to us? Yes, only if you take your own existence seriously can you value those others. In the US we make such a noise about one life lost in a robbery or a car wreck. We show the grief of parents over a lost child. But remember that those lost lives far away are also precious to those few whose lives they touched. . . So, do we need to lighten up or maybe take ourselves a little more seriously? The universe doesn't care about us, only we can care about us."	1	3

There are things you should take seriously like your education, your job and your family. But I think that some people think that they have to be serious about the things they take seriously.

why do some people take life so seriously?	I agree.  The secret to a long marriage, I've found out, is to have a sense of humor about life.  When kids spill things on the carpet that leaves a permanent stain you can get mad or realize that now you have a family story to tell for years.  When things don't go right laugh it off, take a deep breath, and keep plugging along.  If more people had a sense of humor about life and marriage, the divorce rate would not be around 60% as it currently is.  A little laughter goes a long ways.	0	2

As a consequence of the second part, I have to be serious about the choices I make in life. I can't just ""hope"" that I'll do those things which will lead to eternal rewards. I have to compare my choices to God's revealed will in his Word and seek to be led by the Holy Spirit so that I am abiding in Christ when I make a choice."	1	4

I know how I got here, but how did you?	i belive we where created in one form or another and maybe we evolved from something. but i dont belive that a profit was sent or might be sent here from the all mighty god.  but there is something out there that made our existance possible.	1	4
I know how I got here, but how did you?	I'll tell you how I got here: my parents screwed. Who knows what really happened? My theory is that a massive cocktail olive exploded to form the universe, and eventually, pieces of the olive clumped together into sandwitch nebulas, which are nebulas made of sandwitches. Over time, blueberry pies began to orbit the sandwitches, and the gravity from the pies pulled hydrogen atoms out of the sandwitch nebula. Then, the hydrogen started to clump together and started nuclear fusion, and all stars are actually pieces of hamburger left by German spaceships from Holland.	1	3
I know how I got here, but how did you?	I believe in one and only creator who is Allah the Almighty. Allah the Almighty is so powerfull that he can do anything that he wants to do.. In Quran, Allah the Almighty says;. When Allah intend to do something or creat something he just says 'come into existance' and it comes.. In Quran Allah the Almighty invites people to think logically and prudently.. he says in Quran 'See the skies, do you see any patch in these, see again and again, your sight will return to you hopsless'. Allah the Almighty mentions in quran 'This is Allah who give you life then childhood and youth and then brings you to old age similar to childhood'.. There are so many signs to ponder over.If a person thinks neutrally he will certainly recognise the one and only creator who is Allah the Almighty.. Note' quotations from quran are not word to word translation but to give summerised meaning. please refer to quran for exact translation.	1	4

I know how I got here, but how did you?	"""How can something living come from anything that's not."". . I don't know, this is currently being studied by scientists. I think it's wrong to make up an explanation for the unknown.. . ""How can we feel love, compassion, forgiveness...or even jealousy, hate, envy?"". . With our brains. I haven't studied the brain so I don't have an in-depth answer for you.. . ""How can anyone look at their child, friend, partner or even a stranger and not believe in a creator?"". . The same way I look at a chair, a bottle, or a mountain without believing in a creator. I look at a person and don't believe in a creator just like you look at a person and believe in a creator."	0	1
I know how I got here, but how did you?	Fornication by my parental units created the bi-product of me.. .

But, I attribute all of that to the Flying Spaghetti Monster (FSM).  All hail the FSM!	1	4

I know how I got here, but how did you?	I got here because God let my mother's reproductive cell meet with my father's reproductive cell.

And I can't imagine living without that knowledge.  My biggest question is how can anyone live without knowing that someone DID all of this wonderful stuff, and that someone (satan) also did all this not-so-wonderful stuff? . God bless you !!!!	1	4

I know how I got here, but how did you?	"Emotions are the result of brain activity that is unrelated to ""spirits"" or supernatural events of any kind. I'm not a neurologist and how brain cells function is far beyond my ability to explain. But, emotions have nothing to do with ""God did it."" They are directly related to electrical impulses in the brain that are measurable and controllable to an extent.. . The universe has always existed, it was not ""created"" out of ""nothing.' How different life forms evolved is still under investigation and there are no conclusive answers.. . Since supernatural entities, ""God(s),"" do not exist in fact, it is highly unlikely (and illogical based on the creationism gobbledygook they call a theory) that ""God did it."""	0	1

Why is GW dogged for not getting OBL yet killing Zarkawi is a non-event?	"How is the lead story on every news broadcast and every news paper in America on THE LIBERAL MEDIA a non event???  Oh, if you were looking for a boost in the polls, ain't gonna happen.  A moron is a moron, it's just too bad it took 6 plus years for most Americans to figure that out. . . You asked the question though that brings up an interesting point.   Perhaps you should explain just why the mastermind of 9-11 is NOT in custody?  Don't say ""Because he's hiding"", because your idol, W, has said that already.  But he's also said, he's not a priority anymore.  I wonder what 3000 families think about that, but the ""LIBERAL"" media doesn't interview them too much.. . Oh, and by the way, didn't seem like W was all that inspired about the capture of the #2 guy.    Just FYI, #2 is not #1, got it?. . Another thing, . Isn't ""Art"" a LIBERAL thing?

Why is GW dogged for not getting OBL yet killing Zarkawi is a non-event?	As a moderate, who voted for Bush the answer is simple.  Killing Zarqawi is the perfect microcosm of the whole war in Iraq.  Heroic soldiers execute with pefection a plan to track down and eliminate Zarqawi.  Despite this perfect execution, it will not ammount to much change  in Iraq.  40 people were killed and 120 people wounded yesterday despite the actions against Zaraqawi.  . . The reason is this will ammount to no change is that the plan is wrong.  The Bush Administration and millitary brass have put our soldiers into a situation where they cannot succeed.  They can't figure out who is helping and who is the enemy.  This situation could have easily been predicted at the outset of the war with the ethnic make-up of the area and the lack of infrastructure outside of the iron fist of Sadam.  For reasons that are unclear, no one prepared for this kind of war after Sadam was toppled.  I predict we will eventually have Iran 2 for Iraq.  . . It is wonderful that they got Zarqawi, unfortunately it will hardly put dent in the violence.  It might not even chip the paint.	1	4
Why is GW dogged for not getting OBL yet killing Zarkawi is a non-event?	They don't want to see progress, they just want to see us out.  Taking away their ability to wave something around just hurts them deeply.  Don't be too hard on them.	0	1

BUT, if it is a big deal, I haven't heard Bush say we're pulling out NOW."	1	3
Why is GW dogged for not getting OBL yet killing Zarkawi is a non-event?	The sad part of what you point out is the reality of politics.  The left, particularly the far left, can not give GW an ounce of credit or success in anything.  They have successfully beat and beat upon any negative items they can.  Look  how they blew up the prison scandal...certainly some American soldiers went to far and we're punished...but the crime was in politicising it to make GW and his party look bad and give comfort (and ammunition) to our enemies.  . . Isn't it ironic that much of what the DNC produces in terms of talking points match that of al queda today?	0	2

"Because capturing the head of the terrorist organizations is the LEAST he could be doing, not a ""MISSION ACCOMPLISHED"" event.

I've been listening to Rush on and off this morning as well as Al Franken.  Rush claims that the left could care less about this event and Franken decries the whole episode as ludicrous (the episode being the right trying to convince the world that the left is terrorist-loving).  This is a proud moment for the American military.  They did a great deed by ridding us of this terrorist.  Don't generalize.	0	1
Why is GW dogged for not getting OBL yet killing Zarkawi is a non-event?	"I honestly believe he did it as retribution against Saddam for attacking George the elder.. . There is no real way to prove that, but GW did say, in advance of the 9/11 events and (obviously) before determining Iraq was ""a threat"" subsequent to that, he intended to take out Hussein.  It's logical to assume, then, GW invaded Iraq to take out Hussein prior to questions regarding WMDs and possible assistance to terrorist organizations.. . With regard to real economic reasons the US is in Iraq and may go to war with Iran, those are in the realm of unprovable as well at this point in time.  It's obvious we are currently outspending any current fiscal bonuses to be found there.  However, to make it sweeter for our President who is an oil man, if the US has control of the vast oil reserves, GW and his associates will be very, very big players in the world oil alliance if the US is in power in Iraq and Iran."	0	2
Why is GW dogged for not getting OBL yet killing Zarkawi is a non-event?	It doesn't tell me much, as we don't have much of an issue with Iran at the moment.  Yes, they are probably the next country to get G.W. Bushwacked, but on the whole there isn't much going on.	1	3

Why is GW dogged for not getting OBL yet killing Zarkawi is a non-event?	Some non Christian, Group of Non Christians or Current US President created a great plot to commercialize Christian holidays and bring Christianity to is demise. Just think rabbits and eggs on Easter for Jesus rising from the dead, Santa Clause on Christmas for the birth of Jesus, and what about St. Patrick's day? They took a good Christian Saint and turned him into a reason to drink Beer and eat corn-beef cabbage. I rest my case.. . I say it was Terrorist and/or George W. Bush one or the other gets blamed for everything now days anyway so what is one more thing. If you talk to some people they are one in the same. . . Although all the things we blame GW for could be a terrorist plot designed by Osama Bin Laden.	0	2

Once we get this terrible stain forever removed from our country in 2008, we can begin the long process of rebuilding the greatest nation the world has ever known.

why did the army have personal cuts in the mid 1990's?	"After the collapse of the Soviet Union a lot of politicians saw no need for us to have a large military, since we were the only super power left. Unfortunately, many politicians continue to *act* like we have a large military.. . They claim that by trimming the force down some, we can accomplish ""more with less."" However, there comes a time when less doesn't get you more of anything other than exhausted troops."	1	4

why did the army have personal cuts in the mid 1990's?	Actually, personnel cuts began in the early 1990's righr after the Gulf War, under Bush Sr. . . Apparently, the official policy was that a strong army was no longer needed, us being the only remaining superpower. Their shortsighted minds never figured WHY we were the only remaining superpower (because of our superior military), and proceeded to dismantle our armed forces. Both Bush Sr. and Clinton share responsibility for this folly. . . Boy, were they wrong!	1	4

Yes, the cuts started earlier, but the funding cuts and the vastly increased deployments were the ""wag the dog"" of the Clinton Admin.. . I actually kept bags packed in Germany calling the ""scandel bags"" as every time Clinton had a scandel (Whitewater, China Gate I and II, File Gate, Travel Gate, Monica, strange ""suicides"", etc), we would be deployed.  Add to this the unlawfull use of the Army at Waco, TX, the debacle in Somolia, Deployments to Haiti, IFOR/SFOR (you know, the ""1 year missions""), cruise missles into Afghanistan, Missles and bombers daily in Iraq, etc and so on.. . We also had very little money for training, housing, and maintenance.  Fuel was in short supply.  Our tanks could run less than 100 optempo miles/year due to parts, fuel, and other commitments.  Qualifying Tanks had to share ammunition and many qualifications were done in old simulators.  Even rifle and pistol ammo was in short supply.. . This was the state of affairs in 2000 during the elections... and to add insult to injury, the national socialist left did everything possible to throw out the military absentee ballots, and then did it again in 2004."	1	3

why did the army have personal cuts in the mid 1990's?	I believe that the German invasion of Russia failed because the Germans failed to learn from history. The French, also, failed to invade Russia.

Through a scorch earth policy, they destroy all food and shelter. Then they let mother winter do her damage. The invading army simply freezes and starves.	0	1

when it comes to religion why dont people realize history repeats itself?	"You mean like you and all your ""questions"" regarding religion.  You repeat and repeat the same stuff.

when it comes to religion why dont people realize history repeats itself?	"I think FIGHTING for RELIGION is like ""Balling for Virginity"".. . Nuff' Said."	0	2
when it comes to religion why dont people realize history repeats itself?	"That's a pretty broad brush you're painting with, Kero. It's really unfair and incorrect to suggest that all of the monotheistic faiths have ""caused nothing but harm to everyone in and around it."". . A small example: You probably could kiss modern science goodbye as you know it, if it wasn't for the Christians who believed God had placed intrinsic order in the universe that they could discover. Many of the major scientists 200-300 years ago that started the ball rolling believed in God.. . And many of the men who founded the United States were also firm believers. Some were more ""deistic"" (God exists but is detached from humanity and not entirely personal) in nature, but these are only two major contributions of believers in the faith(s) you're putting down. . . That being said, religion has been abused for centuries, as long as man has had it. Any belief system can be abused, especially one that believes that some things are right and other things are wrong. (And the only systems that can't cause damage are those that have no absolute values to exploit -- so they don't do much anyway.). . And there's a lot of garbage going on in our culture right now, regarding religious people who use religion as a means to  control others rather than serve them. So that's frustrating for everyone. . . But I think that's more a problem with the people, than with the belief system(s)."	1	3
when it comes to religion why dont people realize history repeats itself?	People who have faith in their religion think there is no wrong in their religion.  They don't see how it can repeat itself although it does anyway.	1	3
when it comes to religion why dont people realize history repeats itself?	I agree there's going to be another dark age & it's going to be a lot worser that we've ever seen before. Man does not know the way to peace everytime our leader open their mouths & start talking about peace there's a war.

when it comes to religion why dont people realize history repeats itself?	"You assume a lot for someone who's never been in a church.. . ""I know there is about to be another dark age if people are not careful. I can tell."" ... Really, how can YOU tell, are you some sort of prophet of God?  Do you have a PhD in theology?  Let's see some credentials please!. . ""people are just too closed minded and stubborn to see it or care"" ... what people are you referring to?  Are you intimate with these people, did you do a study or a poll?. . ""theyd rather focus on an old religion thats caused nothing but harm to everyone in and around it."" ... Again, how do you know that this is what ""they"" are doing?  Did you do a study and ask a sampling of the religious population what their focus is on?. . Your generalize and assume based on no actual fact, and expect us to believe you?  Your question is moot, as you cannot even provide one fact or shred of evidence to support yourself, other than whats in your own lonely mind.. . So the answer is ... people don't realize it  because it's not happening, you are delusional."	0	2

Well, personally, since there is no clear way of choosing which is the correct religion and if I pick wrong I'm doomed anyways, I'd rather pick None of the above and not side with any of those close minded groups that seem to think they know better than everyone else.	0	2

when it comes to religion why dont people realize history repeats itself?	History is not boring.... It makes sense of the world.  It puts into context how and why everything in this world is so messed up.  I often hear that people study history so we don't repeat the mistakes of the past, but that is untrue... we always repeat the mistakes of the past.  I think we study history to learn how to conquer people and mess things up like people in the past have done.  Learn and follow by example.. . If you are still in high school or lower level grades then you're right... history is boring because they are giving you a watered down version which is often flat out lies. . .  Wait til you get to college... you will learn stuff that will blow your mind... then again, if they lied to us all the way up to high school, maybe they lie to us in college too??? just a thought...	1	3

UAE's people are mostly Cristian after muslims and they are all coping with the situations it is.. Islam is the last religion which has come from god, people believe in god and prophethood.. Muslims believe in all prophets in the history, but we know that the last religion is the most complete and new prophet would be sent by God to people when the last religion is changed or destroyed. Now in Bile there are 101 contradictions and it means that it has to be changed totally.	0	2

I don't understand why some people hate christianism, i mean what is wrong with the original true message to love one another. . If people throughout history used this religion to do bad things ( and continue to) that doesn't make the original message bad , it makes those particular people bad.	0	1

why is islam so hated in america?	"because it is a dangerous religion all over the world that killls innocent people (Look at europe and middle east). . . And the ""peaceful"" islamics don't say anything. They just sit there and let it happen.. . All religion is bad, it is all about controlling each others' minds. If you are young- take my advice coming from an ex-christian. Sometimes man needs religion, but most of the time it just does more wrong than it does right. If it wasn't for religion we may not be here today, on the other hand religion caused the most horrific things ever in this world.. . And yes even though christianity has causd many world problems- the current day problem is islam. Look at Africa and the Middle East, Look at what is happening in Europe and how Europeans are giving into these islamic extremist (Who protest in the streets saying how Europe is going to pay). . ""I think it is because we have been taught that Islam is a religion that believes in violence against all non-islamics and does not give rights to women."". . www.blessedcause.com/htm. and yes they do have very little rights to women. Look how women are killed for not covering their hair in the middle east. That is just one of the many things wrong. Not to say the women aren't to blame for this- since they too follow this Islamic religion and believe it is right."	1	3

why is islam so hated in america?	Americans are doing what Americans do best.  Generalizing a couple of isolated incidents and applying stereotypes to everyone.  Yes, in perspective, terrorism is isolated when it comes to Muslims.  They estimate that there are over 1 billion Muslims all over the world.  How many of those 1 billion Muslims are actually terrorists?  Even if there were 10 million Muslim terrorists...that's only 1% of ALL Muslims.  What did the other 99% do to deserve the hatred?  Do you think that 99% is responsible for stopping the other 1%?  Can all Christians stomp all the fuses on abortion clinic bombs?  (And see what I did?....a few Christians blew up some clinics...now all Christians must do it.  I know its not true, but I am emphasizing how overgeneralization can hurt).. . How many wars were started due to religion?  Think back thousands of years.  Thousands died in the Crusades for this very same reason.  There will always be conflict and hatred when it comes to religion.  There will always be people threatening each other.  There will always be violence.  The cause of the conflict, a lot of the time, is one religion or culture feeling they are superior above others.  If we can just learn acceptance, think where we would be.	1	4

why is islam so hated in america?	"Then I guess you Muslims shouldn't be attacking non-Muslims. Islam is a religion of intolerance and anger.

why is islam so hated in america?	Because there is a whole generation of muslims in the M.E. that were raised to believe that America is the Great Satan and that the only good American was a dead one, even though most of them have never been to America or seen an American.  . This worries and frightens Americans.  This fear leads to hate.. That's why Americans (not all) hate Islam.	1	3

why is islam so hated in america?	"Not sure of the second part of your question but..... . I would venture to say that most people don't necessarily hate muslims in general.  Excluding people who are simply racist in general of course.  . . But the fact that some (much) of the muslim world really doesn't like us very much adds to it.   Attacks on 9/11 and interests in other countries (embassy's, Iran Hostage crisis, Cole, etc)  all leads to outrage and mistrust..  The easy target is people of the same kind and direct the outrage and distrust towards ""them"".  I don't advocate that, just trying to analyze why you may have that perception.. . You don't see/hear much ""hatred"" toards folks like Hindus, Budists and other religions.  Then again, we don't see many  images of Hindus and Budists (etc.) burning the flag and yelling death to America.. . And one must remember that even tho the US is fairly tolerant of all religions, we are predominantly Christian and founded by Christians.  Misunderstanding and ignorance usually leads to distrust and racism."	1	4

why is islam so hated in america?	I don't think that is true.  I don't hate any religion.  And I don't think the majority of the American people do either.. The majoriy of the Muslims I have met are sweet gentle people.  You have to blame the Islamic terrorist for the hatred  you are feeling.  Most Americans don't understand Islam.  Sone think that Islam is responsible for these terror attacks.  It's just ignorance.  I hope that you don't think that all Christians are bad.  I don't think you really do.  We are all human beings.  Some are more closed minded than others.  This is part of life.	1	4

why is islam so hated in america?	If you keep looking, you can find something to blame America for. The truth is, and I don't know why you just don't say it, is that YOU hate America and want to blame the USA for all the worlds problems. There are two problems, one is radical islam and liberalism. Everybody else is caught in the middle as these two extreme cultures clash. It is funny that both liberals and radical islam blames America for all the worlds problems. The US has sent money and aid abroad to most countries in the world and is always the first to step up with the offer of aid during natural disasters. We even offer this to our enemies. When Iran had earthquakes recently, the US was first in line to offer help even though it was turned down. And yet, the world continues to hate the USA. Maybe if we pulled all our troops and business back home, sealed our borders and offered no aid to anyone, you would really see what America has to offer the world.	0	1
why is islam so hated in america?	They are persecuted in all the world. Remember when christ told his deciples in JOHN that the world hated him before they hated us. Here in the US christians are being persecuted also not as bad as in other countries. Islam believes that if you do not believe the way they do they should cut off the head of the infidel. As a christian let them try. I walk in GODS light. Only he can determine my fate! Islam is not a peaceful religion! remember there is only one GOD.	0	2

Contact the home office so to see if you can get an information pack if its available for this type of licence.. . You can get an injunction to stop him from doing anything if he does get licence.

"Why does my Black Lab howl to ""Law and Order"" theme song?"	I have a Black Lab too, they can not be figured out, my dog surprises me every day with his intelligence and great personality.

"Why does my Black Lab howl to ""Law and Order"" theme song?"	Golden retrievers have long fur and narrow noses; yellow labs have extremely short hair. Simple: just look at a black lab and see if it looks the same as a yellow colored lab.	0	1
"Why does my Black Lab howl to ""Law and Order"" theme song?"	I don't have any idea how that song goes, but maybe he associates the song with siren sounds. Dogs have very sensitive ears, as you know. A siren sound literally hurts their ears, because they are very sensitive to sounds. A lot of dogs start howling whenever they hear it, because it's a very high-pitched sound.	1	3
"Why does my Black Lab howl to ""Law and Order"" theme song?"	"Some dogs howl habitually at noises that are unusual to them.  My black lab used to howl at police sirens - not fire trucks, mind you, just police sirens.  Other than that, he was quiet as a mouse. Even coyotes howling couldn't get him started. . . One expert says, if your dog howls during music, he's just sining along, showing he's part of the ""pack""."	1	3
"Why does my Black Lab howl to ""Law and Order"" theme song?"	You should do a science project with him.  Play him the theme songs from these shows:  . . NYPD Blue. L.A. Law. Hunter. The Commish. NewsRadio. Blossom. Hill Street Blues. The A-Team. The Greatest American Hero. Magnum, P.I.. Doogie Howser, M.D.. Quantum Leap. Remington Steele. Renegade. Silk Stalkings. Wise Guy. . See how he reacts to each of theme.  Perhaps he's just really into the musical compositions of Mike Post.	0	2
"Why does my Black Lab howl to ""Law and Order"" theme song?"	Isn't there a siren in there somewhere, maybe towards the end.  Maybe she howls first before the other dogs, or what she thinks are dogs,  at the end.	1	3

"Why does my Black Lab howl to ""Law and Order"" theme song?"	It is part of their normal and natural communication and behavior. Howling is used as a means of long-range communication. Howls are more often associated with wolves, but dogs howl too. They often howl to signify territorial boundaries, locate other pack members, or attract other wolves for mating. Dogs typically howl at sirens because it is a form of stimulation. . . I live by a couple of firestations and my dog does the same thing. I think it's cute because she tries to mimick the sound of the sirens. :o)	1	4
"Why does my Black Lab howl to ""Law and Order"" theme song?"	"""Black cat is bad luck, bad guys wear black must've been a white guy who started all that, get the gas face for those little white lies..."" 3rd bass. Does anybody remember that song?

"Why does my Black Lab howl to ""Law and Order"" theme song?"	It was played as a theme song to the illegal immigrant protests.  Kidron (the British Dude) was tickled by the idea of stirring up we poor provincial nativists.  Unfortunately he didn't stop to consider (or perhaps didn't care) what this would mean to real human beings caught in the backlash. He now says he was just trying to bolster identification with the anthem, but then how does he explain the altered version he came out with turning the anthem into a doggerel theme song against immigration law enforcement? (It includes questions about how can we enforce these 'mean laws' against the 'hard workers' that I assure you are not in the original.). . I don't have a problem with people in any language expressing patriotism to this country, so long as that is what it is.  The message of when and how it was put out, along with groups touting Atzlan slogans and flying our flag upside down, gave it very different color.. . Kidron is here on a visa as I understand it. I hope any deportation feeling stirred up by his actions includes him, as well.	0	1

Why are liberals so quick to defend Saddam?	"Another provocative question from Nicholas ""meathead"" Rage. Liberals as you call us are not quick to defend that piece of sh't, we just want our leaders to thoroughly think out any military operation regardless of reason.

Meanwhile North Korea is testing  long range missles that could hit Alaska or Hawaii, Good job Georgie Boy, we feel much safer now."	1	4

Why are liberals so quick to defend Saddam?	Cause the Liberal Media doesn't wanna admit Bush did not lie.. .

Why are liberals so quick to defend Saddam?	"I think it's more of a case that we will not support Bush, so it just sounds like we are defending Saddam.  . .

I didn't have my friends in the Supreme Court lie to get you in the White House just so you can mess around on Yahoo chat!!! Who cares about Saddam. he was just a puppet, all we wanted to do was use him as an excuse to invade Iraq.Stop messing with the American public trying to defend yourself.  That's too late for that...Look at your approval ratings! Who cares. You don't have to run for office again.  We were about oil and making money all along, son.  Now run along and kiss some Saudi behinds for me....Before I spank yours!	0	2
Why are liberals so quick to defend Saddam?	"We aren't defending him at all. We're just stating facts. Why did we go into Iraq? I've heard time and again it was for WMD's and then sometimes I hear it's because of an Al Qaida connection. Which is it? We wouldn't have an issue if we were told the truth and they were honest with us. There is nothing but backhandedness going on in that White House and look who you're quoting...fox news. Yeah they're balanced...sure they are. There are plenty of republicans out there that are also fed up with the lies that this administration has told us. It's not a matter of whether or not Kerry won...that's done and over with. I haven't heard too many people complaining about Kerry not winning until I listen to people like you. I'm aware of the article Rolling stone did about the ""voting problems"" in Ohio. Maybe you should read that and then make an informed decision. And another thing...why is it ok for us to make WMD's (even though we're not supposed to) and no one else is allowed? I'm not saying I want them to be made but if we signed an agreement which we did, shouldn't we be following it too? Would it be ok if someone else invaded our country because there is a possibility for manufacturing WMD's"	1	4
Why are liberals so quick to defend Saddam?	liberals dont defend sadam. liberals know the truth- sadam was weak and had lost alot of power since the first gulf war. he had no navy, no battle ships, a small airport with no firghter jets, his army was weak, and he had no wmds. the sanctions were working- source: un inspector hans blitz who is neither a liberal or conservative. sadam was a threat in the 80's where he was at the height of his power, and it's funny becasue in the 80's sadam was friends with the u.s. source- photos of him with rumsfield. also we backed him and funded his war against iran. during the sadam trial he mentioned that he hates bush but regean was a great president-becasue regean backed him. you don't know this becasue your not opening your mind from the brainwashing. they are worst dictators to go after such as north koreas, but i forgot north korea doesn't have oil! also sadam was enemies with bin laden because sadam saw bin laden as a lunatic.	0	2
Why are liberals so quick to defend Saddam?	I'm moderately liberal and I don't and would not defend Saddam.. . I think the question is:Why do conservative extremists posing as moderates ask questions that actually apply to few if any actual liberals?	0	2

Why are liberals so quick to defend Saddam?	"... defending Saddam? All we are trying to do is figure out what is going on?. . Why can't republicans use logic or reason when asking a question?

Only today's conservatives would think that way..."	1	4
Why are liberals so quick to defend Saddam?	Just out of curiosity..... . Do you even know what the definition of Liberalism is?  Conservatism?. .

Why are liberals so quick to defend Saddam?	"I am a little liberal. Then again I agree with some Republicans, Democrates, even the green party peeps. I feel that if we took all of their ""good"" ideas rolled them into one we would have such a better world. but anyways..... . . As for Saddam. I wouldn't defend that s.o.s. if my life depended on it. If I were the one to find him in his little hole. I would have shot him dead right there and then. Wanted: Saddam Dead or Alive. I would choose Dead. He does NOT deserve a fair trial nor another breath of fresh air."	1	3

Why are liberals so quick to defend Saddam?	"I don't understand it either they have been harping on the fact we haven't found WMD's then we do and they trivialize them. The fact is whether old or not they are still extremely dangerous and are still WMD's, ask the Lib's if we can dispose of them in their backyard and see if they agree. Most people with common sense knew there were WMD's, remember two weeks before the war started the Russian's warned Saddam and there were survelliance photos of semi's with trailers crossing the border into Syria? Strange but the Dem/Lib won't discuss that either. And this lame arguement that only the most idiotic of lefties will believe 'that those are not the WMD's we went to war for', is the worst that Dem/Lib's are touting, even their own supporters are saying its lame....really, no matter if we find WMD's with a note saying ""these are the ones the American's are going to start a war over, signed Saddam Hussein""  the Dem/Lib's will come up with some excuse....sounds kind of like the 'I did not inhale and I did not have sexual relations with that woman and what do you mean by 'is'""  the leaders of the Democratic Party are doing a grave disservice to the good and honest Democrats and it will show in the next election."	0	2
Why are liberals so quick to defend Saddam?	Nevr mind. I jsut saw what I wanted to see. Ignore it.	0	1
Why are liberals so quick to defend Saddam?	"Sadaam was only doing what this country has been doing for years.  Controlling his people to get them to do what he wanted them to do.  Why is a country not allowed to have weapons. If you don't think that the U.S. has ""weapons of mass destruction"" somewhere, I've got some land I want to sell you in China. It's all about checks and balances, and Sadaam would not conform. He is a threat,  therefore he must be contained. Now because he would not cooperate with the US's ""agenda"" he's a tyrant. I could care less about Sadaam, but you've got to be brainwashed to not see parralels between the two governments. I don't think anyone's defending Sadaam, I think its more of a ""the pot calling the kettle black"" issue."	1	3
Why are liberals so quick to defend Saddam?	"We aren't defending Suddam. We are saying the reason for going to war was a fabrication to gain public support. Face it no matter how you spin it this war was started so that W's defense friends could fatten their wallets, George could tell his father that ""No man can try kill his father and get away with it. The only value to this war is that it has drawn a large number of terrorists to Iraq. . Such a high price to pay for the citizens of Iraq. and other countries. Oh yes, It's about the oil. Quit blaming the Liberals for everything. Conservatives have spent to much, blamed everyone but themselves, and pray to God to help them out of this mess."	1	3
Why are liberals so quick to defend Saddam?	"I consider myself a liberal, and i wouldn't dream of defending Sadaam.  . However, i think blanket statements very rarely, if ever, show a complete picture.  This whole WMD thing is a complex issue, and someone who points out that some of these things were old, aren't defending Sadaam, they are merely pointing out that the WMD argument for going to war isn't as strong as Bush would have us believe.  . This using of the words liberal and conservative as if they are evil epitaphs is not only offensive, but it gets in the way of actual discussions of issues that Are complex and do Not have easy answers.  Debate is the way to find these answers, and to generalize someone in such a way and attack them is juvenile.  Think of the junior high cafeteria, two girls in an argument, one makes a valid point, the other says, ""well you're ugly, so there!""  and suddenly the whole argument is overshadowed by the personal insult.  The argument isn't solved and both people get hurt.  One is embarrassed and the other is seen as a bitch.  . that is exactly what is happening in this liberal/conservative war.. if you want people to see things the way you do, present a coherent argument, and just maybe you'll change someone's mind."	1	3

Why are liberals so quick to defend Saddam?	WASHINGTON — The United States has found 500 chemical weapons in Iraq since 2003, and more weapons of mass destruction are likely to be uncovered, two Republican lawmakers said Wednesday.. . My problem with this is the fact that since 2003, our president has been lying to us.  We were still under the impression of no WMDs.  However, this report would have me believe that our administration has been sitting on this evidence for 3 years.  Why does it not bother you that our president may have been lying to us?	0	2
Why are liberals so quick to defend Saddam?	"I have to laugh everytime a Republican points to something that has to do with nothing, and act like it ""proves"" something. . . ""Hey, Abu Abbas is in Iraq. There's that terrorism link Bush was talking about."". . ""Hey, we found some 20 year old munitions. There's that weapons program Bush was talking about."". . Let's make it simple. Saddam was a bad guy, to most of his own people. But Bush lied to America about him being an imminent threat to America.. . Saddam killed thousands of his own people, but all of the mass graves right-wing idiots point to are from the periods when Saddam was fighting a virtual civil war. We don't say ""Lincoln is evil, he killed hundreds of thousands of Americans"", now do we? Bush Sr. promised we'd help overthrow Saddam. The people rose up, Bush did nothing, and Saddam quashed the insurgency. Does that make Saddam a good guy? No. But you at least need to have some f'n context.. . There are lots of bad guys in the world. I'm glad Saddam is out of power. But if Americans had been told before the war, ""We're going to spend $300 billion to remove a bad guy who's not an eminent threat, and in the process, create (not stop, but CREATE) an entire generation of Iraqi terrorists, and fuel hatred of America throughout the Middle East and the world"", no one in their right mind would have supported that course of action."	0	2
Why are liberals so quick to defend Saddam?	Anything that Bush / Republicans like the democrates / librals HATE...and visa-versa.

The Shea trial is a mess basically Mooktah ElSadder is running the show with hit squad tactics. I love this parody.

Why are liberals so quick to defend Saddam?	"Its just politics. Liberals have in the past denounced Saddam, N Korea, etc - but today - they are incapable of claiming anything is evil, for it would agree with Bush, Reps and cons alike. . . They look at public perceptino, then make a decision after they have poured over that perception. Immediately after 9/11 - every Dem Senator and liberal made grandiose soap box statements  concerning ""evil"" - because the American public required it. Now, that the sentiments are largely against Iraq - they have switched gears and denounce anything ""evil"""	1	4
Why are liberals so quick to defend Saddam?	I believe the reason their arguments don't make sense to hard working American capitalists are because we are thinking in an entirely different way.  Ultimately liberal ideology is based on socialist dogma, which simply isn't compatible.. . The next time you are trying to reason with a liberal, understand that whatever issue you are debating isn't actually the issue, instead focus on why capitalism and a free market society are better than a socialist one!  You'll quickly find that they defend the socialist doctrine, even if they won't admit to being socialist.

Why are liberals so quick to defend Saddam?	First of all Iraq didn't attack us on 9/11.  Al Qaida, based in Afghanistan did.  We are in Iraq for OIL, and a personal agenda of the Bush family, plain and simple.  Typical Texan, running your mouth before knowing what the hell is going on.  I am no liberal, I think Saddam needed his a s s kicked as much as anyone but even I can see the truth!!!	1	3
Why are liberals so quick to defend Saddam?	Because judging by the lefts questions and answers we on the right see the left use words like Nazis, neocons (real meaning- liberal) and comparisons of Bush to Hitler, Osama and Saddam!!! So it is easy to see why we feel that way!!! And it is warranted!!!	0	1
Why are liberals so quick to defend Saddam?	It was about terrorism!!!  Saddam was housing terrorists and promoting them for years!  He has made numerous threats to America and ruined his own country(not to mention the possibility that he may have had WMAs which some people here say they just found them)!  The most common mistake liberals make is that they try to convince people that Saddam and Osama were in this thing together.  THEY WEREN'T!!!  Afghanistan was to take out al Queida and Iraq was to protect us from further attacks from others who do the same kind of tihng...TERRORISM!!!!  If it wasn't for people like you, we may have been outta there by now.	1	3

why do black people like fried chicken somuch?	When I fry chicken without a coating, I put the chicken in the frying pan and cover it with a lid.  I cook it covered for about 20 minutes.  This basically steams the chicken and then I take off the lid and the chicken will brown and leave those tasty bits at the bottom of the pan.. . If I use a coating like dry pancake mix or flour, I fry it with a bit of oil until it has browned and then put it in a roaster with the lid, for about 40 minutes in the oven. (you can use the same frying pan if you want but you have to drain the oil first ).  Take the lid off for the last 10 minutes to crisp it up.  The chicken will be tender and moist.	0	2

How does spending prolonged time in microgravity affect the bodies of astronauts?	Lack of pressure on mucles and spines can cause them (the muscles and spines not the astronauts) to deteriorate. Astronauts strap themselves to bike machines and excerize for hours daily when in space to maintain at the same health they'd be if they were on Earth not excercizing at all. If they fail to keep their muscles and bones active, they can experience painful damage to the muscles and even early signs of osteoperosis, the deterioration of bone mass that people on earth experience when they don't have enough calcuim, which can lead to injuring the bone. However, the excercise is easily enough done that maintaining gravity inside spacecraft is not an issue.	1	4
How does spending prolonged time in microgravity affect the bodies of astronauts?	"Yes, astronaut is the US term, cosmonaut is the Soviet (Russian) term. Get used to hearing a new one too, Chinese astronauts are called ""taikonauts"", from the Chinese word for astronaut, taikongyuan."	0	1

How does spending prolonged time in microgravity affect the bodies of astronauts?	Astronauts do not see any man made objects from space.  They see the clouds, land, and water.	0	1
How does spending prolonged time in microgravity affect the bodies of astronauts?	first of all, the international space station has no natural supply of oxygen, the oxygen supply comes from machines that generate it. second of all, you cannot keep soil in one pack in microgravity, everything there would just appear as clumps of things	0	2
How does spending prolonged time in microgravity affect the bodies of astronauts?	Because the more closer to space the colder it gets that's why the astronauts were those heavy and worm space suits and some peoples body temperatures are different than yours some may be 98.6 and others may be 99.00 and they aren't sick and vise verse	0	2

how to get rid of a skunk?	we live in the country so these Lil' critters like to make their themselves  known on occasion. They only spray when they get scared so if you run into one face to face just back away slowly and they will go the other. Don't get excited and less you want sprayed. To keep them away from areas you don't want them sprinkle black pepper in that area about once per week and again after a good rain storm, they hate the smell and will back away quickly, soon they will remember that area has that smell and not bother to come around. Keep all outside pet food picked up for the are looking for food. keep trash picked up and get rid of it daily if possible or keep in tightly sealed cans. And NEVER EVER let your dog chase them off unless you want to be washing it up the next few days. Good Luck	1	4

how to get rid of a skunk?	"If you get a bad keg, that's rare... it's probably a problem with the keg itself, not the beer. You CANNOT get a skunked keg of beer, but the batch may be off.. . Beer skunks because of a reaction to light; beer in green bottles and clear bottles will skunk faster than beer in brown bottles. When beer fills a keg, it does not have enough time to skunk outside of the brewing keg. Ergo, it cannot skunk. But it could be a batch that's gone off because of age, or because it's been tapped and retapped incorrectly. If this is the case, then the place you got it is kind of sketchy. They shouldn't be selling ""used"" kegs. . . If you really think that you have a bad keg, don't drink it, 'cause, well, ew, but bring it back. If they give you a problem with it, don't let them; they can turn it back into the distributor for a full refund, so they shouldn't have a problem helping you out. They probably won't issue you a refund, but you may be able to change out the keg.. . Just don't try it if you've had more than a quarter of the keg; if they can feel the difference in weight, they're going to laugh you out of the store. If you go out for dinner and don't like your meal but you eat it, you're not going to get any sympathy."	0	1

what causes gray facial hair in men?	"Grey hair occurs because there is a lack of pigmentation available to ""color"" the hair as it grows out of the follicle.  People gray at different rates, but losing pigment is uaully a genetic issue.  Did your parents grey prematurely?"	1	3
what causes gray facial hair in men?	I started getting gray hair when I was 16 blame it on your parents because it's in your genes.	1	3
what causes gray facial hair in men?	Hair color comes from melanin (say: meh-luh-nun), the substance that gives hair and skin its pigment. The lighter someone's hair, the less melanin there is. A person with brown or black hair has much more melanin than someone with blond or red hair. Older people lose the melanin pigment in their hair as they age, making their hair look gray or white.	1	4
what causes gray facial hair in men?	Have you ever watched someone try to cover up gray hair by dyeing it? Or maybe you wonder why your granddad has a full head of silver hair when in old pictures it used to be dark brown? Getting gray, silver, or white hair is a natural part of growing older, and here's why.. . Each hair on our heads is made up of two parts:. . a shaft - the colored part we see growing out of our heads . a root - the bottom part, which keeps the hair anchored under the scalp. The root of every strand of hair is surrounded by a tube of tissue under the skin that is called the hair follicle (say: fah-lih-kul). Each hair follicle contains a certain number of pigment cells. These pigment cells continuously produce a chemical called melanin (say: meh-luh-nin) that gives the growing shaft of hair its color of brown, blonde, red, and anything in between. . . Melanin is the same stuff that makes our skin's color fair or darker. It also helps determine whether a person will burn or tan in the sun. The dark or light color of someone's hair depends on how much melanin each hair contains.. . As we get older, the pigment cells in our hair follicles gradually die. When there are fewer pigment cells in a hair follicle, that strand of hair will no longer contain as much melanin and will become a more transparent color - like gray, silver, or white - as it grows. As people continue to get older, fewer pigment cells will be around to produce melanin. Eventually, the hair will look completely gray. . . People can get gray hair at any age. Some people go gray at a young age - as early as when they are in high school or college - whereas others may be in their 30s or 40s before they see that first gray hair. How early we get gray hair is determined by our genes. This means that most of us will start having gray hairs around the same age that our parents or grandparents first did. . . Gray hair is more noticeable in people with darker hair because it stands out, but people with naturally lighter hair are just as likely to go gray. From the time a person notices a few gray hairs, it may take more than 10 years for all of that person's hair to turn gray. . . Some people think that a big shock or trauma can turn a person's hair white or gray overnight, but scientists don't really believe that this happens. Just in case, try not to freak out your parents too much. You don't want to be blamed for any of their gray hairs	1	4

Why do man Arabs hate the west ?	Arabs and other Muslim countries don't hate the people living in the west but they hate western government's foreign policies, especially America's. The idea of imposing a war against terrorism on Iraq and Afganistan has made things worse for people living there. Killings have become a part of their daily lives since the 'war' has happened.. . I'm afraid any traces of nuclear weapons couldn't be found there in Iraq. So, the war on terror can't be justified. Above all, the UN Channel was ignored by American Administration. . . In Iraq there are atleast 20 innocent people are killed everyday. Who's a terrorist for the Arab world? Saddam or Bush?	1	3

Why do man Arabs hate the west ?	"The source of the Arab Nation's (the children of Ishmael's) animosity towards the world goes back to the Bible:. . ""And the angel of the Lord said unto her (Hagar): 'Behold, thou art with child, and shalt bear a son; and thou shalt call his name Ishmael, because the Lord hath heard thy affliction. . . And he shall be a wild man of the desert: his hand shall be against every man, and every man's hand against him; and he shall dwell in the face of all his brethren."" (Genesis 16) . . The Arabs are the half-brothers of Jews, but they hate Jews because the Jews were given father Abraham's inheritance.. . In modern times, Jews were able to develop the State of Israel into a modern democratic nation offering the world advancements in medicine, technology and agriculture. Meanwhile Arabs, in their 20+ countries, continue to live under oppressive dictators as they always have. They are jelous, and jelously in Arab culture is experienced as Shame. The way they deal with this shame is to lash out."	1	4
Why do man Arabs hate the west ?	Muslims don't hate the West, Its the other way around... . Muslim are just unfortunate to have oil under their feet Capitalists corporations want..	1	3
Why do man Arabs hate the west ?	Egypt is really strongest Arab country but Iran and Pakistan are not Arab. If Iran and Pakistan had been included in Arabs, Pakistan would be the first and Iran would be second and Egypt would be the third. Egypt is not comparable to other Arab country as Iran is to Egypt and as Pakistan is to Egypt. . . . From all these answers we can conclude that not many people in the west do know what is the middle east and what is their efforts. for exampe Iran has a different case. Iran and other Islamic world are a bit separated. likewise Pakistan is. The countries that are ally are Arabs like Syria Jordon, UAE, Qatar, Bahrein, Saudi Arabia, Egypt and maybe iran and etc .	1	4
Why do man Arabs hate the west ?	"First, ""Muslims"" do not ""hate the West"" that is a stupid argument to make.  . . Second, The ""West"" surely wants people to think stupid like that though. The U.S. government has already attacked the Islamic faith by desecrating the Koran in its prisons, and humiliating Muslim detainees in Iraq and Afghanistan with pornographic material--not to mention torturing and sometimes murdering them. The U.S. has also backed Israel’s repression of Palestinians--joining most recently in the threats against Hamas after the Islamist party won the Palestinian legislative elections.. . At home, the U.S. government used the September 11 attacks to launch a witch-hunt, complete with FBI “interviews” of thousands of Arab and Muslim men, secret detentions, deportations and systematic racial profiling."	1	4

Why do man Arabs hate the west ?	I think the reason why the Muslims hate the west is because we show off to much. We get into other cultures wars because we feel like we have to but the Muslims think it is an intrusion on their policy. They think the west is to full of its self. But these are not facts only opinions.	1	3
Why do man Arabs hate the west ?	"This is not a question, but a rhetorical bit of propaganda.  Nevertheless, the Middle East situation is the key background info that most Americans do not really appreciate:  I recommend the Academy Award Winning movie Lawrence of Arabia for a better understanding of why we Americans have so many enemies in the Arab world.. . OK:  your question is both incredibly stupid and, when looked at deeper, incredibly deep and important.. . First, let's get incredibly stupid out of the way.  Since both the Arabs and the Jews but especially the Arabs are guilty of murder in that part of the world,  the question is definitely stupid . . . HOWEVER . . . .. . What most Americans do NOT realize is where all that Arab hate came from.  Let me explain that hate:  visually!!!  I live in Colorado, and in case you haven't looked at a map recently, Colorado is one of the largest states among the 50.  Eighth largest between larger Nevada and smaller Oregon.  So if you're looking at a map of the western USA and see the Rocky Mountains running north to south through Colorado, imagine everything 69 miles east of the Rockies being taken away from the Colorado people and given to another group and the name of that place being changed to ""New Israel.""  I think you can guarantee that for untold history, the former inhabitants would hate and resent all the occupants of New Israel.  That's exactly what was done in 1947 when Israel was created out of Arab land.  Jews had not lived in that area in any significant numbers for many long centuries, but out of guilt for not having done anything sooner (Hitler began tormenting German Jews as early as 1933) Europe and the USA eventually stood behind the Jewish state.  That's where the hate comes from and that's why the hate will not end ever.. .   If you also watch Lawrence of Arabia, you'll see that the lies of the British and French to the Arabs were about like the promises of the White legislators to the Indians during America's westward expansion.  That's why we are so mistrusted because we aligned ourselves always with the British.. .   So, stupid question but the hate beneath it, needs to be understood."	1	4
Why do man Arabs hate the west ?	muslims dont hate the west. i am muslim and i do not hate the west. all i can tell u is this, if u really think like what u wrote, i feel sorry for u,  u have been misled into racism and prejudice by the media....good luck trying to free urself from its control over ur weak little brain	1	4

Why do man Arabs hate the west ?	All the trouble about the cartoons was caused by a few Muslim CLERICS. . who in their hatred for the west saw an opportunity to incite their people to vent anger at the west.. if you read and listen to the news in nearly all interviews you will hear someone this was not how it was supposed to be. . every demonstration about the cartoons had been hijack by Radicals and fanatics hell bent on creating exactly what happened more hate between the west and east.. Terrifying to know that a handful of people can wield so much power of so many. Oh and the UN sucks Always has and Always will.	1	4

How do i get my pitbull more agressive?	"The majority of responses are on the ""mark"".  You don't want him/her more aggressive, you want it to protect your house.  You must create a bond with your dog, as Pit Bulls make it their life's mission to please their owner.  Understand that all Pit Bulls do not bark.  But if you create a close enough bond with your animal they will not welcome in an intruder.  They will show their teeth, growl and run an intruder away (without biting), they will corner (without biting) an intruder in your house and not allow them to leave until you get there.  An ideal Pit Bull will not do more than that, but are certainly effective.  You don't want a ""maneater""!. . Creat the bond, forget aggressiveness and more importantly read up on the breed.  Unfortunately, too many people acquire Pit Bulls without truly understanding the breed itself.  They are the most loving, entertaining, loyal and respectful animals that I have had the pleasure of raising.. . Good luck to you and your dog."	0	2

Try getting another dog! It's not your pits fault he's a lover not a fighter! Think twice about making him mean! Once he locks his jaws there locked!!!!

How do i get my pitbull more agressive?	Why would you want to make him more agressive? I hope you don't have kids. But, on the other hand to make him more protective or assertive over his domain you should give him something to be protective over. Maybe a toy or something your dog can lay claim to. Eventually this instinct will mature and make him behave more as an alpha dog in his domain. But by making him agressiv... it could cause problems for you and or your family down the road.	1	4
How do i get my pitbull more agressive?	Herbs, your head must be a little under the influence of HERB... Why not getting an alarm system instead?  You're asking for trouble.  It's so sad when you go to a local animal shelter, and find out that most of the dogs in death row are pits.  If only people knew what they're getting into before they make such a commitment.  Owners shouldn't have dogs if they get them for the wrong reasons.  Later on they find out that having an aggressive dog is more a liability than an asset.  Don't do harm to this dog, you don't need that, trust me.  In the long term, it's more rewarding to have a loyal and loving dog, than a dog that will bring you nothing but trouble and inconveniences.	1	3
How do i get my pitbull more agressive?	I really hope you don't want an aggressive dog.  I am sure you have a loyal dog and had you been there and he felt your life was in danger or you were hit he would have defended you even if it was to his death.  I am sure that is what you want.  Once a dog is trained to be aggressive he is not safe to be around.  My sister had bull dogs and thought they should be aggressive and thought it was funny that everyone was scared of them.  She fell and broke her hip and then her dogs were not safe around her as they know they could overpower her.  After one of the 5 attacked her she had to give them to a bull dog rescue.	0	2
How do i get my pitbull more agressive?	Trying to make him more aggressive is why pits have such a bad name.  Talk to a trainer about some protection/guard dog training.  They should be trained by a professional and not you.  You need to go with him when he is trained and learn how to control him afterward.. Good luck	1	4
How do i get my pitbull more agressive?	If this is a dog is in a neighborhood setting, I suggest weighing the cons posed by having a dog that is aggressive.  One bite and you could be looking at law suit city.  Even if the bite occurs while someone is breaking in, you could be liable for a dangerous dog.. . Good for your dog to have self preservation and to hide.  Smart dog!!!  Robbers usually know if there is a dog there and will come prepared to eliminate any threat posed by the dog (ie they neutralize the dog with mace, bludgeoning, etc.) or trick it into one room with food and lock it in there and still take your stuff.  I know you want to protect your stuff but you are much better off having a better alarm system or locks or living in a safer part of town.. . Most 1 year old dogs are not mentally mature enough to be guard dogs without professional training.  They gain confidence about their territory and protecting it in the years to come.	0	2

When you can walk down the pavement without him ripping some yorkshire terriers head off.. . Also it will save you in vet fees,. . Love him and he will love you which surely is why you got the puppy in the first place, if nit then perhaps you need to reconsider why you have him.	0	2

what do i do if i have not started my period in like almost 6 months?	"OK the baby answer is getting old.  . . If no baby on the way - then yes it is a hormone, but no ""the pill"" is not the cure all.. . The reality is that most women who have period problems usually have one of two issues.  1.) low body fat  or 2.) low fat consumption.  Hormones are made by fats ingested in the body.  If the wrong type or amount of fats are being ingested, then the body has a hard time regulating the hormones produced.  In addition often times severe stress will cause this as the hormone precursors are pushed into what is known as the adrenal cascade - this is where the body uses the hormone precursors usually used for estrogen and progesterone and begins using them to assist with stress managment hormones.  . . A simple adrenal stess profile - a urinalysis any doctor can order, but usually not done by any one other than a doc practicing functinal medicine - will let you know how your hormones are working.  . . Regardless - if it is a fat intake problem - I would recommend supplementing the diet with some fish oil (if not preg.) or with flax seed oil.  Both are wonderful for a host of conditions and support normal hormone production.. . As always, a non-expensive, simple blood test by any doc can rule out the more serious issues - and they should be ruled out.. . Best of luck"	1	4
what do i do if i have not started my period in like almost 6 months?	See your gyn doctor.

Book an appointment with your gyn to know what's happening.	1	4

Obviously pregnancy is not the issue otherwise you would have definite signs this is the reason. . . Again, be seen by a medical professional as there are a number of reasons that this delay exists.  . . Good luck	1	4

what do i do if i have not started my period in like almost 6 months?	Is it normal for you to skip periods?  Some women go a long time without menstrating natuarally but if you're not one of them something is definitely wrong.  Are you extremely underweight?  Could you be pregnant?  Have you just recovered from an illness?  Are you nursing?  Are you on birth control?  If you answered yes to any of these you might be ok.  Otherwise, please take a day off work and go to the doctor.  You probably have a hormonal problem that can be easily corrected with medication.  Stress can cause your period to be a few days or weeks late, but never 6 months.  Take care.	1	4

Even the group of girls she hangs out with, Don't ask me why but when a group of girls all hang out on a regular basis, something happens and their period times will start changing to where they all basically start around the same time!. . But on a more serious note, stress is a big factor on late periods, New sexual parteners will effect it too, or even new types of sexual activities.. . Eating, sleeping all normal habits changing can cause it to be late too. . Then the biggie, Pregancy, but that isn't a late period, that is a period but on pause for 9 months!	1	4
what do i do if i have not started my period in like almost 6 months?	Most likely it has to do with stress.  It's not unheard of to completely skip a period because of it!  Have you been extra active lately?  Sports can also have something to deal with amenorrhea (lack of a period).  Very active women sometimes skip periods for that reason.  Your body could also just be adjusting its cycle.  That happens sometimes.  I've been known to have periods every other month when not on birth control!  (I've been on the pill for a while - it's great to regulate your cycle - mine always starts on the same day!). . Let this one slide, but if you don't get a period next month, then definitely go see a gynecologist!	1	4
what do i do if i have not started my period in like almost 6 months?	just carry on taking them, you will skip this months period but will still have full contraceptive cover!	0	2
what do i do if i have not started my period in like almost 6 months?	"Taking pills so that you only have your period every couple months has the same side effects of the Birth Control Pill and the Birth Control Patch. And that's all it is... not taking the break for your period.. you just start your new pack instead of going onto the fake pills and getting you period. I do this. I love it. Think of how much a pain in the butt having your period is... cramps, headaches, possiblities of ""accidents"", having to go to work or school with it, having to run to the bathroom every couple hours to change a tampon, and just the overall feeling of ""blah"". I choose this option to go through this as little as I can. I've talked to my doctor about this and she says its completely fine to do it as long as the bc pills I'm taking are the white ones, and as long as I don't do it more then 3 months at a time. So I get my period every 3 months. Plus, I don't have the 6 day gap where I can't have sex.. . Its all a plus to me!"	0	2

what do i do if i have not started my period in like almost 6 months?	Federal loans aren't really all that bad.  You don't start paying them back until after you graduate and then at that time you have a 6 month grace period.  Once you do go into repayment they make the amounts are very reasonable.  I know of student's with over $70,000 in federal loan debt and their payments are less than $300 a month.  Don't stress out too much about things now.  I would suggest talking to your financial aid office to see if there is any help they can give you.	0	1

Why am I alive?	I think it was a natural kind of biological thing! We evolve, we grow and learn, hopefully have the right kind of environment that fosters a happy well-rounded individual. Sadly, most of the time, it only happens in the books. We live because we were born, our lifes are based on choices made when we were young and immature. If we didn't have good guidance, or if we were too rebellious to listen, then we suffer and we decide ourselves why we live. You are the only one who can say why you continue to live. No one can tell you the answer to a question that mankind has been asking since we were able to ask? I quess we live, to fulfill our destiny...which is of our own choosing. Did that make any sense at all?	1	4

Why am I alive?	Easy. . If you're dead then you are not alive so you are dead, if you are dead then how can you be alive, so you can not wake up dead since you are not alive but if you are alive then dead then you know you are dead so you have to be dead to wake up dead but you don't know you are dead if you are not alive but if you are alive then sure you know you are dead but after you are alive then dead you do not know you are dead so you have to be alive to know you are dead. If you are not wake when you are dead then you do not know you are dead. So you can not wake up if you are dead only if you are alive you know you are dead then after you do not know you are dead only if you were alive to be dead.. . . Got it. . Hope this helps	0	2

Why a man float on water when he dies?	A human is naturally a little lighter than water so will float naturally.. Immediately when a person dies his body will begin to get rid of a lot of oxygen, and other gases, primarily from the lungs and the blood stream.  When these gases are expunged from the body, the body will sink.. After a while the remaining gases will begin interacting with the tissues and muscles and chemicals in the body and those gases will swell up, causing the body to float again.	1	4
Why a man float on water when he dies?	Because our bodies are less dense than the water	1	4

Why a man float on water when he dies?	Density and displacement. If the coin were hammered into a thin bowl then, although the metal is more dense than water it would be spread across a wider area and it would displace less than its own weight in water, so it would float. That's why metal ships float. The wood is naturally less dense than water so it floats on water.	1	4

Why a man float on water when he dies?	When a man dies his/her cell starts to die individually, that is cell death(apoptosis) during the process each cell starts to swell due to release of organell bound enzymes inside the cell that cause lysis of organlls & releas of gases that cause swelling of the cell & eventually the organism volume increases relative to the mass,thus mass&#92;volume=density,decreases & the dead body floats!!	1	4

Why a man float on water when he dies?	The density of an object tells us weather it will float in water or not.

If the relative density>1, then the substance will sink.	0	2

Why a man float on water when he dies?	Like most things that float, ice floats because it is less dense than liquid water. Ice is about 9% less dense. When ice forms, it takes up about 9% more space than it did as a liquid. Thus, a 1 liter container of ice weighs less than a 1 liter container of liquid water, and the lighter material floats to the top. It is according to the rules of physics.. By the laws of . . By the way, it is due to the difference in Hydrogen Bonding between water and ice..

Why a man float on water when he dies?	If they were tha same density, the ice would float at the surface of the water. As more dense water buoys a body floating in it, the amount below the surface is 920/1030 so the amount above the water is 10.6%	0	2
Why a man float on water when he dies?	If you take a balloon under water, and go further and further, the air becomes more dense...due to PRESSURE.   The way a submarine dives is completely different then denser/less dense ....it's that they are mostly filled with air...so they should float...but they have enough weight that they sink too,  it's almost a balance, but they have tanks that they let fill with water to sink, or push air in (and water out) to get lighter and float.	0	2

"actually there are animals that get stds,.....but nevertheless, if there was a cure for ""aids"" as an example, then there would be no money needed for research.  the cost of research is what pays for researcher's paychecks. why find a cure when you can make more money not finding one?  you can make more money from eggs than you can from chickens but which one came first?....in this case, it doesnt matter because you can make money off both. there are cures for things like ghonnorhea, syphillus,and control drugs for things like hpv and cold sores which are also stds. then there is conjunctivitus which is also an std. so is small pox in some ways.  STD means sexually transmitted, you dont neccessarily have to have sex to get a disease transmitted, all you need is contact with the dna of the disease which can come off of a handshake (common cold) (warts) or it can come off a dorrknob or toilet seat, from beathing the same air as someone who's infected and all manner of other ways. this sint to say ""dont go outdoors"" or ""dont have friends"".....the fact is, the more exposure we have to disease, the more we become immuned to it. new diseases pop up as the population increases,.....all over the world.........science can invent vaccines but that doesnt mean they will work all the time.......as for animals, the armadillo, the common sheep, goats, pigs, squirreels, many birds and many reptiles carry common diseases......the armadillo and sheep can carry ghonnorhea and can transmit it by eating unproperly cooked portions of that animals meat.......you ever hear of bird flu?....it goes to humans, ever hear of equine encephalo myalytis?...it can be transferred to humans (sleeping sickness).........there's alot of animals that can get sick, cats can have all manner of diseases from ringworm to leukemia and aids.....some dogs can transmit disease and not be effected.......study up."	0	2
how can i cure the std or the sexually transmitted disease?	STDs are diseases that usually spread during sexual activity.  There are many different types of STDs. Some STDs are caused by viruses, others are caused by different bacteria.  Some STDs infect your sexual and reproductive organs. Others can cause general body infections. Sometimes you will have symptoms caused by the STD infection, while other times the symptoms may be so mild that you don't even notice that you have the STD. . Either way, you have the STD until you have been medically treated.  STDs can occur again and again because immunity can not usually be built up and there are no vaccinations against them.  The consequences of untreated STDs can be sterility, blindness, and even death!  .  . check out the web site	1	4
how can i cure the std or the sexually transmitted disease?	"""Genital HPV infection is a sexually transmitted disease (STD) that is caused by human papillomavirus (HPV). Human papillomavirus is the name of a group of viruses that includes more than 100 different strains or types. More than 30 of these viruses are sexually transmitted, and they can infect the genital area of men and women including the skin of the penis, vulva (area outside the vagina), or anus, and the linings of the vagina, cervix, or rectum. Most people who become infected with HPV will not have any symptoms and will clear the infection on their own."""	0	2
how can i cure the std or the sexually transmitted disease?	STD has various types...and you cant just take any medicines to treat it. you have to see a doctor for a proper treatment if you wanna live longer.  prolong exposure to std will/might develope HIV due to prolong infection in your body so its up to you.....:). . . Sexually transmitted diseases, commonly called STDs, are infections that are spread by having sex with someone who has an STD. You can get a sexually transmitted disease from sexual activity that involves the mouth, anus or vagina.. . STDs are serious illnesses that require treatment, regardless of whether or not you are pregnant. But, when you are pregnant, you are not the only one at risk; many STDs can be especially harmful to you and your baby. Some STDs, like HIV/AIDS, cannot be cured and are deadly.. . Your health care provider will likely screen for some STDs at your first prenatal visit , but if you have sex with someone who is infected, you will need to be screened at subsequent appointments and treated. If you suspect you have an STD, be sure to tell your doctor immediately. Fast treatment is the best way to protect you and your baby.. . STDs include:. .     * Herpes.     * HIV/AIDS.     * Genital warts (caused by human papilloma virus, or HPV).     * Hepatitis B.     * Chlamydia.     * Syphilis.     * Gonorrhea.     * Vaginitis . . What Are the Symptoms of STDs?. . Sometimes, there are no symptoms. If symptoms are present, they may include:. .     * Bumps, sores or warts near the mouth, anus, penis or vagina.     * Swelling or redness near the penis or vagina.     * Skin rash.     * Painful urination.     * Weight loss, loose stool, night sweats.     * Aches, pains, fever and chills.     * Yellowing of the skin (jaundice).     * Discharge from the penis or vagina (vaginal discharge may have an odor).     * Bleeding from the vagina other than during a monthly period.     * Painful sex.     * Severe itching near the penis or vagina. . How Can I Find Out If I Have an STD?. . At your prenatal visit, your health care provider will screen for a number of STDs. But, if you think you have an STD, tell your provider. He or she can examine you and perform other tests to determine if you have a sexually transmitted disease.. . How Can I Protect Myself From STDs?. . Here are some basic steps that you can take to protect yourself from contracting STDs:. .     * Consider that not having sex is the only sure way to prevent STDs..     * Use a latex condom every time you have sex. (If you use a lubricant, make sure it is water-based.).     * Limit your number of sexual partners. The more partners you have the more likely you are to catch an STD..     * Practice monogamy. This means having sex with only one person. That person must also have sex with only you to reduce your risk..     * Choose your sex partners with care. Don't have sex with someone whom you suspect may have an STD..     * Get checked for STDs. Don't risk giving the infection to someone else or your baby. Just because you've been screened for STDs early on in your pregnancy, does not mean that you can't contract one later during your pregnancy. If you engage in unprotected sex with more than one partner since your last STD screen, you need another set of screening tests. Also, you should be concerned if your partner is having unprotected sex with other people..     * If you have more than one sex partner, always use a condom..     * Don't use alcohol or drugs before you have sex. You may be less likely to practice safe sex if you are drunk or high. Plus, alcohol and drugs can harm your developing baby..     * Know the signs and symptoms of STDs. Look for them in yourself and your sex partners..     * Learn about STDs. The more you know about STDs, the better you can protect yourself.. . How Can I Prevent Spreading a STD?. .     * Stop having sex until you see a health care provider and are treated..     * Follow your health care provider's instructions for treatment..     * Use condom	1	4

what color you like the most and why?	Please don't use that light mint green color.  I don't know why so many places use that. I've come to refer to it as institutional green. . .

what color you like the most and why?	most animals do see in black and white...but thats because there eyes dont have color receptors like ours.

Let me explain....We know that sun light has the full spectrum of visible light....Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Violet.When light bounces of a leaf(lets say) we seen the color green. The reason why this happens is because the green spectrum of the sun light is reflected back to us while all the other colors are absorbed by the leaf.There for...dont worry....our wonderfull universe does have color.	0	2

what color you like the most and why?	I don't know why it smells so bad, but I do know why it is brown.. . The brown coloration is a combination of everything in your stools. The most color-prominent components are bile (yellow, and made by the liver) and dead red blood cells.	0	1

If you think about it red symoblizes danger (as a rule) if you something something red it is telling you not to do it. Or red ALSO catches your eye quicker than any other color (proven through a 12th grade science project) . . Green is a positive color and yellow is a negative color (per color therapy). . It's possible, I don't know :D Just my theory and yammering on ;)	1	4

why the media in US and Europe is always attacking the Arabs and Islam without finding the truth about them?	really simple! because the media is a tool utilized as any other tool to serve the purposes of political powers ! it has never been about the truth, he who wants the truth must seek it the hard way not be fed by propaganda machines	1	4
why the media in US and Europe is always attacking the Arabs and Islam without finding the truth about them?	"the answer would be for arabs who call themsleves ""palestinians"" and all the other arabs/muslims to stop attacking israel and leave it in peace. Example, israel left gaza, thus  it was no longer ""occupied"" so what did the muslims in gaza do??? they STILL CONTINUED to attack israel!!! over 500 rockets launched. Islam MUST end its war against israel"	0	2
why the media in US and Europe is always attacking the Arabs and Islam without finding the truth about them?	Living in the UK, I am lucky that that a lot of our media is prepared to take a broader view on topics. Certainly, there are a lot of examples of the British media taking time out to explore Islamic culture and to try and portray a more accurate view of lifestyle and culture.. . In the sources below, I post a link to a radio documentary broadcast on BBC last weekend which I believe provides an in-depth and objective view on the topic. It's two hours and has some fluffy stuff before the programme, but well worth listening to.. . However, the media will report news. A group of Arabs sitting in a coffee shop discussing philosophy isn't news and won't get reported.. .  Agroup of muslims taking to the streets of London demanding that a cartoonist be executed for drawing some pictures is news. It also runs against the culture of fairness and free speech that is the core of our democracy - so it is certainly going to portray Islam in a bad light.. . The Western culture has a very different way of undertaking protest. It tends to be non-violent and based around debate. Yet whenever we see Islamic protests they seem to involve threats or actual violence, flag burning and intimidation.. . In the case of the London protests, these were not born out of fruistration at not being able to make a point - these were the first instincts of protest.. . You see, Islam and the Arabs have a real image problem in the West. It isn't just a problem with our media not understanding you - it is just as much about you and your media not attempting to understand us.	1	4
why the media in US and Europe is always attacking the Arabs and Islam without finding the truth about them?	Man I would get kicked off yahoo again if I said what I wanted to say, but yeah I think you are right. Because if the Arabs get mad they will attack the Jews before they attack Europe. So maybe its for the American benefit in the end.	0	2
why the media in US and Europe is always attacking the Arabs and Islam without finding the truth about them?	Because Christians just preach back at them when they are attacked.. It seems to be much more dangerous to attack Islam.	0	2
why the media in US and Europe is always attacking the Arabs and Islam without finding the truth about them?	the crusades WERE are counter attack to muslim invasion of europe.. its really that simple, then the european christians wanted jeruslam back.... it did not belong to arab/muslims..	0	1

why the media in US and Europe is always attacking the Arabs and Islam without finding the truth about them?	The media everywhere love presenting it like that, I guess because so much of the media is conrolled by the American government..

I know from personal experiance this is true and also it was recentky in the news if you remember	0	2
why the media in US and Europe is always attacking the Arabs and Islam without finding the truth about them?

why the media in US and Europe is always attacking the Arabs and Islam without finding the truth about them?	"Where in the media are Arab people attacked? When a bomb is set off, do the news people say, ""All Arabs did this?"" When the media reports an attack, would they be doing anyone any good to hold back a bomber's nationality because it may offend you? If a bomber were Irish, or Spanish, or American, the media would be all over it. I do not accept your premise. I believe you are operating under a false assumption."	1	3
why the media in US and Europe is always attacking the Arabs and Islam without finding the truth about them?	As a muslim, I would like to say that we are trying our best to change people's opinion but the biased Media is very strong and we are very weak as to stop them from spreading  the false message which it gives about Islam.  Now you tell me you have heard so many things about Islam and what it teaches, have you been fair to Islam and picked up the Holy Quran and read what it really has to say?. . http://askmuslims.com	1	3
why the media in US and Europe is always attacking the Arabs and Islam without finding the truth about them?	The media is destroying the image of Islam.	1	3
why the media in US and Europe is always attacking the Arabs and Islam without finding the truth about them?	No Christian country faired very well persecuting their Jewish minority, look at spain, it used to be the richest country in the world, in todays money its wealth would be more then america's budget of the past 50 years, most of their gold was plundered by revenging Jewish pirates in the carrebian (most caribian islands have jewish cemetries with pirate signs on graves), who knows where the Gold whent, allot was sunk, some whent to the Dutch as they let in the jewish expellees, some reinvested in America and some hidden in places only the dead pirates know of.. . Whilst jews genraly dont go on a avengence campain, the downfall of spain in a mere 10 years left an impression on mideval europe about what the Jews are when they are in their country, and what their country is when the jews are not there. The Jewish Talmud makes its students more sharper then those who are not.. . So chrisitans arent interesting in starting another jewish persocution age, and Islam reared up its own head againt christanity. Jews living in arab lands where called dimis, they where servants of the states with little to no rights, when all the Jews left the arab countries, the arabs where very scared on what would be. So when they attack, they think they are attacking both christian and the jews who whent to the other side of the fence with them.	0	2
why the media in US and Europe is always attacking the Arabs and Islam without finding the truth about them?	Because people want to blame something. And the media is telling them to blame Islam. . Because there are some people who are just ignorant and dont wnat to know more, they just want to sit back and throw the blame on some one else.. . Then there are the cowards, who move with the wind, if some one blames Islam,  then they join them.. . There are those who love violence and hatred and spread it against Islam...... . Many reasons.	1	3
why the media in US and Europe is always attacking the Arabs and Islam without finding the truth about them?	"its just another attck by islam against non-muslims... this is not a Israel vs. (so-called) palestinian event, this is part of a much larger and older event dating back 1400 years since the begining of islam. This is also a world wide event with terrorism from muslims happening in over 28 seperate countries that have nothing to do with eachother except for the fact that they are all under attack from the same people, with the same idology. . There has never EVER been a nation, state, or country of palestine AND when from 48-67 ARABS occupied the land they now claim for yet ANOTHER arab/muslim state (gaza, half of jeruslam, and west bank) NO STATE WAS MADE! this has never been about a fake people called palestinians (who are simply arabs, no different in anyway) this is about intollerance for a single jewish state of isreal on a planet with 57 muslim states.. the hammas and ""palestinian"" authority are simply pawns in a game, and no different than the people who flew planes in 9/11 or shot 300 russian kids, or attack hindus in India, or murder hundreds of thousands of christians in sudan or.. (the list is just too long)"	0	1
why the media in US and Europe is always attacking the Arabs and Islam without finding the truth about them?	The Arab countries are, basically, disfunctional, for all we are able to discern.. . We also know that all the Arab states expelled all the Jews who lived in them after the first Arab attack on Israel. We know that Jews are not even allowed in many Arab states. Freedom to worship does not apply to non-Muslim religions in many Arab states. Christians and homosexuals are attacked in public. They publish hateful propaganda against Israel and Jews.. . We know a lot, actually. But are just as prone to stereotypic them as everyone is prone to stereotyping us.. . As for 'fair', what does that have to do with reality?	1	3
why the media in US and Europe is always attacking the Arabs and Islam without finding the truth about them?	people think muslims are terrorist because of wat the media is saying and ppl believe in wat media are saying ya noe.. and how in media they show that uneducated,crazy, and lack of knowledge in islam ppl are killin ppl and showing A BAD IMAGE TO ISLAM and having a bad reputation in islam also... people think muslims are all crazy and terrosit BECAUSE OF THOSE PPL.. its sad 2 see watever the media says every1 sees and believe.. and dont give any time to look and see how MOSTTT muslims are not like that at all... common sense.. why you think these crazy ,lack of knowledge in islam ppl are killin and doin all this stupid stuff? . THYE WANT FREEDOM,JUSTICE, AND THEIR OWN LAND..! INSTEAD OF AMERICA TAKING ALL OF MUSLIM LANDS.. and THEY WANT 2 LIVE IN PEACE... with doin all these crazy things they think they can get their attention and do sumthin about it.. but ya noe..	1	3
why the media in US and Europe is always attacking the Arabs and Islam without finding the truth about them?	They are delusional. The media in the US is extremely more conservative than the rest of the Western world. All of Europe laughs that anyone could ever think our media is liberal.	1	4
why the media in US and Europe is always attacking the Arabs and Islam without finding the truth about them?	Yup to stir up trouble in the middle east..  We support Israel because we need them there, Israel attacks the arab countries, the arab countries defend themselves, Israel cries anti semitism and then the US says leave Israel alone arab countries they are good guys. Blah Blah blah..  Israel never should have been created. Judaism is a relgion not a race of people.	1	4
why the media in US and Europe is always attacking the Arabs and Islam without finding the truth about them?

Maybe we are all being brainwashed to believe all Arabs are bad so that no one objects when the oil companies go in to take the oil?	1	3
why the media in US and Europe is always attacking the Arabs and Islam without finding the truth about them?	"First, ""Muslims"" do not ""hate the West"" that is a stupid argument to make.  . . Second, The ""West"" surely wants people to think stupid like that though. The U.S. government has already attacked the Islamic faith by desecrating the Koran in its prisons, and humiliating Muslim detainees in Iraq and Afghanistan with pornographic material--not to mention torturing and sometimes murdering them. The U.S. has also backed Israel’s repression of Palestinians--joining most recently in the threats against Hamas after the Islamist party won the Palestinian legislative elections.. . At home, the U.S. government used the September 11 attacks to launch a witch-hunt, complete with FBI “interviews” of thousands of Arab and Muslim men, secret detentions, deportations and systematic racial profiling."	0	2
why the media in US and Europe is always attacking the Arabs and Islam without finding the truth about them?	my friend dont get so upset about it all,try to understand that in general people only hear about islam in the media connected to the actions of fundamentalist extemists so naturally think that islam means terrorists- as a percentage of the islamic people the the terrorists are minute in number and the vast majority of muslims know they are an evil representation of the beliefs and teachings of islam-but they are not taught that by the media-if a christian blows something up the question of his religion is never even brought up because its not them that are being pillorised by press indoctrination its you.POLITICS!.X	0	2

why the media in US and Europe is always attacking the Arabs and Islam without finding the truth about them?	Many here in Europe think this as EUROPEANS KNOW ABOUT THE IRAQ WAR. Americans obviously don't and that is why some call them evil- when in fact Americans just don't know.. The government runs the media (They have had their biggest ever profits in all the wars the us has ever had)	1	3
why the media in US and Europe is always attacking the Arabs and Islam without finding the truth about them?	This is not true, Islam is a message of peace not a strategy of war.. People shouldn't criticize things without knowing the truth.	0	2

Honor was at stake with kamikaze pilots, so to not be in their complete uniform would be a sign of disgrace.	1	4
Why do Kamikaze pilots wear helmets?	Dusty is closest, but pilots at that time mainly wore helmets to protect themselves from taking a hard bump to the head.  Flight, especially not at low altitudes and in combat conditions and in piston-engined planes, is not smooth.  And inexperienced pilots, as most of these guys were, were shakier than their more experienced (but mostly dead, by 1944) brethern.. . A hard bump could knock them out and make their Ultimate Sacrifice even less meaningful.	1	3
Why do Kamikaze pilots wear helmets?	Actually, there were three main reasons that they (and MOST pilots of the era) wore those leather helmets. 1- to keep their heads warm, the cockpits were not heated, so they wore lined leather helmets (and jackets and gloves). 2- to contain their earphones for communication. 3- to fasten their goggles and oxygen masks on. Many had an up-turned flap on the top where they also wore an emblem.	1	4
Why do Kamikaze pilots wear helmets?	This is no answer...but interesting fact...kamikazes were treated like royalty once they became pilots.  They were given a purple sash to wear and they were given anything they wanted.  Any woman was theirs, they paid for nothing, they were bowed down to.  After the war, those who were left alive and recognized were scorned.  Treated like vermin.  No one would have anything to do with them.  Kind of like getting kicked off of the varsity football team huh?	1	3
Why do Kamikaze pilots wear helmets?	Why wouldn't they, i doubt whether japanese regular pilots wore helmets, they look like padded leather head gear for their radios???	1	3
Why do Kamikaze pilots wear helmets?	Because inside the helmet was the communication headset so they could hear the aircraft radio. It also kept their heads warm. Anyone acquainted with aviation or basic physics knows, the pilot's helmet has never been intended to provide protection against a crash. If the plane encounters the landscape too abruptly you're sausage no matter what you're wearing.	1	4

How Does Water Pressure Change?	At your home, a water utility supply line into your home is typically only 1 inch in diameter.  This 1 inch pipe is split multiple time to route water to every watter connection in your home i.e toilet, shower, sink, outside faucet.  Each of these connections is typically only 1/2 inch...so the more open lines a home has the lower the pressure will be, as the incoming pressure from the water company is held fairly constant.	1	4
How Does Water Pressure Change?	Uneven changes in the air pressure against inner tubes.  Some people have problems with this even with minute changes in air pressure.  Do you get motion sickness on long car rides?  If so, you should see the doc because they may actually be able help alleviate the pressure changes.	0	1
How Does Water Pressure Change?	your probably sensitive to barometric pressure changes	0	1
How Does Water Pressure Change?	Battery in series arrangement will have a combined voltage(force) to push more current to the bulb.. For simple analogy, It is similar to water level in a narrow container gaining pressure at the bottom the more you add water. Parallel arragement is similar to increasing the volume of water without changing it's height thus maintaing the same pressure at the bottom.	1	3
How Does Water Pressure Change?	It's more of a pressure difference which occurs.  When water vapour goes out through the stomata, pressure in the leaves decreases and hence water is sucked in towards the lower pressure.. . Capillarity and root pressure also helps.	0	1
How Does Water Pressure Change?	1)typical atmospheric pressure is 1atmosphere or 10^2kilopascals or 760mmHg.. 2)Atmospheric pressure decreases with altitude.So external pressure decreases.As preessure decreases volume increases(if the temperature change is insignificant). 3)Water pressure increases with depth (P=h*density*g).So as external pressure increases the volumme decreases.. 4)Here we assume that the temperature doesn't change in the process.Use Boyle's law PV=P'V'. so 760*V=1.30*0.21. which gives V=3.59*10^-4L	0	2
How Does Water Pressure Change?	In your house? Most cities have water towers. As the tower gets fuller the pressure goes up. As you use the water it gradually goes down. Most cities have automated systems when the tower or pressure gets so low pumps are activated to refill the tower. This is the basics. Alot more involved in the treatment and other processes.	1	4
How Does Water Pressure Change?	Well it depents on the source of water supply, if it provides higher pressure then more water will pour out the hose. Water consumers also affects it, if there are consumption occuring from the same supply then the pressure gets lower.. . Altitude doensn't affect that much.	1	4

How Does Water Pressure Change?	It is a unit of pressure. In air ducts the pressure measured is very low and the can use a column of water. eg if the air pressure will move a column of water 3 inches then the pressure is 3 inches water (column). Approx 27 inches of water is one pound per square inch(psi)	1	3
How Does Water Pressure Change?	air pressure.  as most airplanes are pressurized when flying, and this pressure changes as the airplane changes altitude (that's why your ears pop as the pressure changes).  This changing pressure in effect squeezes the ink chamber, forcing the ink out.	0	2
How Does Water Pressure Change?	Contrails - Are condensed water vapor that you can see, created by airplanes. They come from either the exhaust vapors, or the rapid change in pressure from the wing tips.	0	1
How Does Water Pressure Change?	Sound is changes in air/gas pressure so if you have no air/gas of which to change the pressure you have no sound.  I'm thinking the energy would be converted to heat and motion of the particles colliding rather than generating changes in air pressure or sound.  A perfect vaccum is an absense of of all matter.  This is an unacheivable state so there will still be gas in the container it is just at a lower pressure than the atmosphere.	0	2
How Does Water Pressure Change?	weight of water * acceleration of water = water pressure applied on turbine blade. Turbine blade is free to rotate & we get energy of water converted to rotating energy of turbine.	1	4
How Does Water Pressure Change?	Headaches are normally caused by changes in blood pressure. When you alter you’re intake of carbs (carbs and sugars are almost the same) or salts, the result is a change in blood pressure.. . The mechanism is not easy to explain, but it has to do with partial osmotic pressures of glucose and electrolytes in blood and hormones regulating their concentration. It has to do with your kidneys and their ability to drive out or filter those excess solutes in your blood. It also depends on the ability of your tissues (mainly muscles and liver) to store glucose as glycogen.. . So a headache is a multivariable phenomenon, I recommend you should drink healthy amounts of water every day and fruits.	0	1
How Does Water Pressure Change?	Here's a water-pressure calculator:	1	3
How Does Water Pressure Change?	even water has weight.as u go deeper, more amount of water goes above u and u feel the collective weight. hence as u go deeper, water pressure which is proportional to the weight of water above u increases.	1	4
How Does Water Pressure Change?	pressure difference betweem top and bottom of straw.  . . Sum forces, acting down to push water out of straw = weight of water plus (pressure acting on top of water column * area of column {straw}).  . . Force acting up to keep water from running out of straw = pressure acting upward (atmosphere) * area of straw.. . Set force up = force down, you get that the column of water will descend until the weight of the water left in the straw = area of straw * (upward pressure {atm} - downward pressure {partial vacuum on top of column because it moved down a little}).	1	3
How Does Water Pressure Change?	The pressure becomes greater the deeper you go, due to the weight of water pressing down on it. One metre cubed of water weighs a ton.	0	2
How Does Water Pressure Change?	Well it could be a change in air pressure. When I was in Keelung,Taiwan the atmospheric water and air pressure was so intense around mid-Spring that it caused me terrible ear aches and temporary demished hearing in my left ear until the end of the season.	0	1
How Does Water Pressure Change?	I think it is probably do with the way the temprature change makes the blood vessels expand or contract, causing changes in pressure inside the body, which may increase the desire/need. Or, it is the sound of running water. But one hopes we have more control than that by now. :-)  Keep in mind, I am not a Doctor, nor do I play one on TV.. . Imran	0	1
How Does Water Pressure Change?	the low pressure and also the soluble compounds that are in the water will decrease the boiling point	1	3
How Does Water Pressure Change?	Its called a manometer. A U shaped device half full of water with on end connected to, for example, an air duct and the other end open to the atmosphere. The pressure in the duct will force the water in the manometer up the atmospheric side so many inches. The pressure is then measured in inches of water.	1	4
How Does Water Pressure Change?	Lower the pressure, the easier it is for water molecules to escape the surface tension of the water and become vapour. Similarly, the lower the air pressure the lower the temperature and the easier it becomes to this vapour to condense..	1	3
How Does Water Pressure Change?	Because the air inside is denser than the water, you require significant downward pressure to submerge the ball.  (Since every action has an equal and opposite reaction, there is upward pressure on the bottom of the ball from the water.) Once the downward pressure is released, the water's pressure shoots the ball upward.	1	4
How Does Water Pressure Change?	In meteorology, an airmass or air mass is a large volume of air having fairly uniform characteristics of temperature, atmospheric pressure, and water vapor content. Air masses cover many hundreds or thousands of square miles, and slowly change in accordance with the terrain they are over.	0	2
How Does Water Pressure Change?	Coolant Pressure tester is the best way. PM depends on the car. Some cars {Honda,Mitsu, Toyo}the water pump is driven by the timing belt. Best real world idea is to change it with the timing belt if that is the case.	0	2
How Does Water Pressure Change?	Water normally boils at 100ºC,which means it´s has the energy to push the atmosferic pressure. If the water is free to escape, it will not get hotter than 100ºC.  But if its trapped with no contact of atmosferic pressure, you can get water as hot as you want.	0	2
How Does Water Pressure Change?	High temperature  of the liquid (water) leads to increase in gas pressure, which leads to gases abandoning the liquid.	0	1

I wish everyone could quit.  I don't think it would put millions out of work.  There would be millions off new jobs created from the fall out and lots of healthy people to do the work.  have fun!	1	4
why is the new jersey smoking ban not considered unconstitutional?	isn't the damage to the people working/coming into the establishment unconstitutional?. .

They are trying to regulate that for the whole country, like no smoking in bars.

why is the new jersey smoking ban not considered unconstitutional?	What does the law say? No smoking in public. I think that's a great law. If we all wanted to smoke, we light one of our own. But if it has to do with smoking at home, I think that's wrong. If you want to kill yourself and not hurt others in the process, then that's fine.. . Hey Bunchick, Why don't they ban tanning beds or sunbathing? How 'bout all the smog we inhale?	1	3
why is the new jersey smoking ban not considered unconstitutional?	Constitutionality is the status of a law, a procedure, or an act's accordance with the laws or guidelines set forth in the applicable constitution. When one of these directly violates the constitution it is illegal, or more specifically unconstitutional. All the rest are considered constitutional until declared otherwise.. . An act (or statute) which is enacted as law either by the council of a city or county, by the legislature of a state or province, or by a national legislature, may be declared unconstitutional. When the proper court determines that the act in question conflicts with the constitution, it finds that law unconstitutional and declares it void in whole or in part. The portion of the law that is declared void is considered to be struck down, as the statute is considered to be struck from the statute books.	1	4
why is the new jersey smoking ban not considered unconstitutional?	I think they are allowed to drink in pubs...unless the bar man decides the person has had enough and it would be incompetent of him to serve any more alcohol.. . As for the smoking....Its considered to be anti-social to some people and being a carcinogenic and passive smoking proven, why should the health of a non smoker be put at risk because of someones selfishness to polute their body?. If it was only their body they were poluting then fine...but as it's not.....it's banned in enclosed spaces.	1	3
why is the new jersey smoking ban not considered unconstitutional?	Because smokers have rights too ... smoking is legal and people have a right to make their own decisions even if it is bad for them.  If the government were to ban everything that's bad for people then you have to ban fast food too because that will clog your arteries and give you a heart attack if you have too much.  Cigarettes are the same sort of thing.. . As for second hand smoke, it's all about ventilation.  Outdoors smoke dissipates, the outdoors is a natural ventilation system.  Indoors, they can put in ventilation systems that cut down on second hand smoke.  Because places like bars and restaurants are public but are also business owner's private businesses, those business owners should be allowed to decide whether or not they want to allow smoking in their business.  If an owner decides to allow smoking, then people that are paranoid that the guy smoking a cigarette with his beer is going to give them lung cancer can go somewhere else.  People should all have choices.. . Smoking bans are really a kind of tyranny imposed on smokers by the non-smoking majority.  While they might not approve of smoking, banning it is really rather cruel.  It's as if you were thirsty and had a bottle of water but were told by the government you weren't allowed to drink it.. . The last thing I'm going to tell you is creating a smoking ban is pointless if you don't enforce it.  That means you need to create a smoking police and a system to punish smokers.  That costs money and is a questionable priority given that there are murderers on the loose.	0	2
why is the new jersey smoking ban not considered unconstitutional?	Unconstitutional means it's breacking the constitution (USA laws). Illegal means state laws. I think	1	4
why is the new jersey smoking ban not considered unconstitutional?	They didn't compromise because what you described is not how the US elects presidents.  The Virginia and New Jersey plans were used to establish rules of elected House Representatives and US Senators.  The US subscribed to the Virginia Plan on how it would elect congressional representatives which was by population.  The New Jersey Plan was used to elect Senators--two per state, completely opposite of the Virginia Plan.	0	1
why is the new jersey smoking ban not considered unconstitutional?	"First ; WE THE PEOPLE - live in a  democracy where freedom reigns!  What is the big hoorah?  The government makes $$$$ in tabacco taxes. I am a smoker and to some degree I understand the smoking in restaurants due to children and expecting mothers but in bars???  come on it is all adults who are there to get their drink on and what is a drink without a cig. BORING! . . SECOND: We The People - are going to lose our freedom, our rights, and our democracy status  the ban on smoking started in a small area and now it is nation wide and beyond ( Castro banned cigar smoking in public areas) go figure!  The ignorant are all proud of the ban success which is leading to what is now-pro-life vs pro-choice-. In South Dakota the Governor banned abortions and any doctor caught performing one will automatically serve 5 years in prison. now wait-the law there stipulates that a woman can ONLY have an abortion if it is life threatening to her.  If she becomes pregnant by rape or incest then she must carry the baby to term!!!!!!. WE woman are still considered second class citizens what the hell will we become if we are stripped of our rights!!!!!  TO CHOOSE.  WAKE UP PEOPLE we the people are fading. 1st smoking now our bodies.. we live in AMERICA we are free to choose what is best for us!!!  ""-look beyond the smoke sreen-"""	1	3

why is the new jersey smoking ban not considered unconstitutional?	Hello! People VOTED for these smoking bans. It was on the ballot in Florida a few years ago and people voted to ban smoking in certain places. This is why people have to vote. If you have a problem with the way things are than do something about it! In Florida, as far as bars go, it's up to the owner. If they don't want people to smoke, they can prohibit it. If the majority of the sales is food, you can't smoke at all in that establishment. Personally, I don't want to smell smoke when I'm eating either.	0	2
why is the new jersey smoking ban not considered unconstitutional?	None whatsoever,Why do u think all around the world Smoking is being banned in public places more n more.. Especially around young children, as it causes SIDs (sudden infant death) around babies.. This is amongst a multitude of respiratory/heart diseases that  you can get from prolonged smoking.. More n more Doctors/Surgeons will not operate if you do not stop smoking, I can go on n on as it killed my Mom so I hate smokers.....	0	2
why is the new jersey smoking ban not considered unconstitutional?	I think the laws have become extreme and although I can see why they are there to prevent passive-smoking, they inhibit people's freedom at the same time.. . There is so much campaign out there to stop people from smoking full stop and not just in pubs but at the workplace too.  I guess this is good when fires can be started from not puting out a cigarrette and that makes sense.  . . But if they are going to ban smoking they may as well ban drinking when there so many accidents on the roads relating to drink.  . . They may as well ban anything that is seen as a threat to human life itself because the way we are going, we are going to be dead anyway from all of the pollution and global warming! - so, yes, I think that banning smoking is ridiculous when governments won't fork out money they tax us, to stop the effects of global warming. . . Instead they tax us more for the problems that they have created!	1	4
why is the new jersey smoking ban not considered unconstitutional?	Because a business owner should have the right to decide how he wants to run his business. Does he want a smoke free bar or tavern, or a smoking bar or tavern should be his choice, These smoking bans HURT small local bars and taverns and people lose jobs. I know of six right now that stand a good chance of losing their jobs after Ohios smoking ban takes effect.	1	4
why is the new jersey smoking ban not considered unconstitutional?	Alcohol was banned in the US during prohibition, but it was a terrible failure.  The bible doesn't forbid alcohol, it states that you shouldn't get drunk and abuse it.  While the US government is based on religious beliefs, it also believes in allowing people personal freedom.  Most places in the States have banned smoking in close quarters (ie restaurants) and public drunkeness.	0	2
why is the new jersey smoking ban not considered unconstitutional?	Smoking and drinking are not banned because we in the US have the freedom to kill ourselves if we want to.  By the way, you can believe in whatever you want.  It's a free country.	0	2
why is the new jersey smoking ban not considered unconstitutional?	I am pretty sure they banned it.  Determined it was encouraging kids to smoke.  You can find some of the old promo items on EBay, but can't get anything new from the company.	0	2
why is the new jersey smoking ban not considered unconstitutional?	Well, they should ban it. Sitting next to a smoking person can be very hard, especially when you hate the smoke... If they want to smoke, they can do it at home.	0	2
why is the new jersey smoking ban not considered unconstitutional?	anybody can drink in a pub if your old enough and of you arn;t you can have soft drinks, as for smoking, I am a smoker, and we have a designated smoking area, but this summer all smoking will be banned as in Ireland, alot of pubs are considering large outside heater/lights so that people can sit outside in the winter, but quite honestly when they ban smoking in the pub I shall give up, because as it is I smoke outside the back door coz nobody else in the house smokes! and I wish somebody could tell me exactly how much money I have wasted over 25 years! it doesn,t bear thinking about, so if you don.t already smoke. don't start and if you do try and give up, you don't sound old, pack it in and buy some cd's instead, much better idea!	0	2

USA have Snow, Hurricanes, Flood, Earthquakes and politicians, Brazil only have politicians, why?	Flash Floods are quick-rising floods usually occurring as the result of heavy rains over a short period of time, often only several hours or even less. . . Flooding is caused in a variety of ways. Winter or spring rains, coupled with melting snows, can fill river basins too quickly. Torrential rains from decaying hurricanes or other tropical systems can also produce river flooding.	0	1

USA have Snow, Hurricanes, Flood, Earthquakes and politicians, Brazil only have politicians, why?	Man's technology has had detrimental effects upon the ecology--oil spills, nuclear accidents, strip mining, poor agricultural practices, overhunting/overfishing, polluted rivers & lakes, etc.. . However, there would still be earthquakes, hurricanes, tornadoes, cyclones, tsunamis, volcanoes, floods & the like whether man inhabited the earth or not.	1	3

USA have Snow, Hurricanes, Flood, Earthquakes and politicians, Brazil only have politicians, why?	That's a good question.  You see, Geoge Bush has a weather machine that he uses (like many of the all powerful presidents before him) to instill fear on the general public.  Brazil has rainforests that induce enough fear with their diseases (and in all due respect, cures for diseases as well), but never fear, the Americans are here!  We'll cut them down and turn the trees into receipts at Walmart and Happy Meal boxes at McDonald's for all the kiddies to enjoy!  You have politicians because America hasn't decided to use an outsourcing technique in Brazil that would replace the politicians with cats and large insects.	0	2

USA have Snow, Hurricanes, Flood, Earthquakes and politicians, Brazil only have politicians, why?	It's certainly there. When I lived in Texas, I saw torrential rain, high winds, flooding, the remnants of a hurricane blow over (rain, winds, flooding), experienced some very hot days in the summer, and experienced bitter cold, a little snow, and an ice storm in the winter. Legend has it that tornadoes can also strike in Texas.	0	2

USA have Snow, Hurricanes, Flood, Earthquakes and politicians, Brazil only have politicians, why?	tropical depressions/storms and named alphabetically from a list.  only certain storms grow into hurricane status, that is why the hurricanes arent always the very next letter (Katrina, Rita).  also, some letters arent used (Q,X,Z, they may be another).  if they run out of english letters, they use greek letters.	0	2
USA have Snow, Hurricanes, Flood, Earthquakes and politicians, Brazil only have politicians, why?	If you believe the liberal media, I'd guess President Bush, Vice President Dick Cheney, and Secretary of State Condoleeza Rice...in that order.  They are actually the Holy Trinity...that why everything that happens in the world can be attributed to them.  Just read the papers and watch the news, they'll tell you that the Bush administration is responsible for the tsunami, the hurricanes, the earthquakes, and everything else under the sun!	0	1

USA have Snow, Hurricanes, Flood, Earthquakes and politicians, Brazil only have politicians, why?	Maybe if we launch a nuke near where tectonic plates are and cause an earthquake, then a tsunami...That's severe. But if you're talking about everyday activities like watering the flowers, I don't think that can contribute to servere weather such as hurricanes.	0	1
USA have Snow, Hurricanes, Flood, Earthquakes and politicians, Brazil only have politicians, why?	Several reasons. 1) A hurricane is larger and covers more area while a tornado is much smaller and may only hit one house and leave the neighbors house.  A hurricane can be 500 miles wide, while a tornado is 2 miles wide at most.. 2) A hurricane has storm surge and flooding rains, while a tornado is usually rainless.  A tornado can do more damage to one particular location, but hurricanes have widespread damage.	0	1

Why do I keep seeing people on here 'dissing' on the soldiers in Iraq?	"The reason there is disdain for soldiers is possibly because they volunteer to go kill people who just want to be left alone completely.    Our soldiers don't have any business there, and if there was a draft, our eager government would see how many people will dodge it and it might open their eyes to the travesty this all is.  All soldiers are only machines that the government has control of; they follow commands and are ""fixed"" if they don't.  Anyone soldier that dies is a mere blurb on the 16th page of the NY Times, a faceless and momentary care."	1	4

Why do I keep seeing people on here 'dissing' on the soldiers in Iraq?	It isn't a double standard at all.  The insurgents are not subject to the Uniform Code of Military Justice, only American Soldiers are.  The Iraqi people are subject to their laws (and law enforcement) and soldiers are subject to military law (and law enforcement).  That some Iraqi people violate their own laws is no reason for American soldiers to act in a criminal manner.	0	2
Why do I keep seeing people on here 'dissing' on the soldiers in Iraq?	"because they shouldn't go over there to fight in a war for our ""C"" average president, i know in ways they are fighting for their country and for our protection, its just that people that have had a loss of a solider or a close friend that is how they just express their anger.  I'm not saying I'm against  the war because I'm not (hello its for my protection) but this war is already settled and its time for our troops to come back....they are trying to handle another countries problems....who cares let that other country solve their own problems...anyway i agree with you and i also think that its time this war is over."	1	4

We disagree 100% with the lying thief in command Bush. But we would never disrespect our fellow soldiers or country. These right-wing fascists that say Democrats disrespect the soldiers are full of sshhit. This war is based on greed and lies, that is fact. It is an UNJUST war. That doesn't mean we disrespect any soldiers, we ARE soldiers. Democrats are mad because the war is a lie and it is costing BILLIONS of dollars and thousands of US soldiers lies. Of course Haliburton is making millions on it too. If right-wing nerds love the war so much, THEY should go volunteer. AND shut up. They're too busy golfing though. And who is ""dissing"" soldiers anyway?. Also, no one has used the term ""diss"" in years, especially if your white."	1	3
Why do I keep seeing people on here 'dissing' on the soldiers in Iraq?	I haven't seen anyone talking badly about the soldiers in Iraq.  I think most people have sympathy for the soldiers.  It's the policies that have all of you in the Middle East that are upsetting.. . I think the problem arises because supporters of the War think people who are against the war shouldn't speak out against it.  . . If I don't believe in the War I am not going to feel guilty about supporting a war nor will I go out of my way to coddle the service people.	1	3

I don;t know what oath they took for USA army, but usually it is like "" u'll defend your country in any case"". if they r fight in Iraq, they r not fighting for USA to defend O.KAY...... they r just their to kill some one innocent....who is very furious revenging and fed up of USA troops killing civilian...and in that fight ur relative could also be killed.....and its true...and that is y when they came back from this war they got caught over with guilt and become physique case.....isn't?. this could be harsh but fact......so thank God we are not in their place..bcoz we cannot kill any innocent people..."	1	3
Why do I keep seeing people on here 'dissing' on the soldiers in Iraq?	Name a single person who has said anything bad about the troops. And, Kerry is not one. He was clearly talking about Bush and anyone who would bother to just look at the sentence immediately before the clip the Republican lie is based on would no that. . . Within a few months following Tuesday’s election, Bush will begin redeploying the troops in Iraq. He is leaving them there for now because he knows it would hurt Republicans at the polls if he did it before then. But the bottom line is that he is leaving them there to be injured and die for his own personal political reasons, and not for any military strategic purpose.. . Iraq is lost – just like Colin Powell and Bush’s father predicted would happen. If anyone disrespects the troops it is the Bush administration who sacrifices their blood on the altar of Osama Bin-Laden for immoral reasons. You may not like it, but that is the truth. Every death in Iraq is purposeless (except to benefit Bush and his gang of US Constitution destroying fascists).	1	4

Why do I keep seeing people on here 'dissing' on the soldiers in Iraq?	"Anything good that happens in Iraq makes Bush look good. It makes it seem like going to Iraq wasn't a bad thing.

Why do I keep seeing people on here 'dissing' on the soldiers in Iraq?	"The Republicans are not blaming the military.  The media is.   More soldiers were killed in one day at Normandy, Battle of Iwo Jima, Battle of the Bulge...etc., than the whole war in Iraq.  But the media maintain a proper perspective.  More people are murdered in the US everyday than in Iraq.  Where is the outrage?. Since when is ""Staying the Course"". a bad thing.  Staying the course only means having a determination not to fail.  Winston Churchill ""Stayed the Course"".   Staying the course is only the route you take to obtain victory!"	0	2

As it was, though, we gave Saddam a year to pack up his weapons and move them/hide them, plus prepare all his evil terrorists for when the Americans arrived!  It wasn't a good start, then to have so many unfaithful American's announcing they won't and don't support our military in Iraq, (poor men and women soldiers to feel that their country turned against them.) Then for the soldiers to hear from loved ones about the negatism on the evening news, rather than about all of the Iraqi people who LOVED the Americans and THANKED them so much for being there to HELP them!   Now, with a civil war, even I'm ready to bring our Americans home!  What gets me is WHY the evil segment of Iraq's people don't want peace!  I guess the bottom line is that when you begin teaching a kid at only 2 years old to ""HATE"", it justs becomes who they are!"	1	3
Why do I keep seeing people on here 'dissing' on the soldiers in Iraq?	Well there never were, but the fact that the Allies waded into Iraq against all international law, and that innocent Iraqi civilians who hated Saddam (who taxed to death honest hard-working Iraqi people during his reign) want them out and get blown to bits by US soldiers daily, will surely make the Iraqi people want them now! I'd be pissed of if I were an Iraqi citizen right now. But NO WMDs IN IRAQ! It was a lie to justify a groundless war. All imperialist and slightly Machiavellian foreign policy if you ask me.	1	3

The REAL reason is that she did not want to 'incriminate' herself or her colleagues, in the mishandling of information prior to the attacks, and the subsequent falsehoods that led to the illegal war with Iraq. . .

Why do I keep seeing people on here 'dissing' on the soldiers in Iraq?	As a moderate, who voted for Bush the answer is simple.  Killing Zarqawi is the perfect microcosm of the whole war in Iraq.  Heroic soldiers execute with pefection a plan to track down and eliminate Zarqawi.  Despite this perfect execution, it will not ammount to much change  in Iraq.  40 people were killed and 120 people wounded yesterday despite the actions against Zaraqawi.  . . The reason is this will ammount to no change is that the plan is wrong.  The Bush Administration and millitary brass have put our soldiers into a situation where they cannot succeed.  They can't figure out who is helping and who is the enemy.  This situation could have easily been predicted at the outset of the war with the ethnic make-up of the area and the lack of infrastructure outside of the iron fist of Sadam.  For reasons that are unclear, no one prepared for this kind of war after Sadam was toppled.  I predict we will eventually have Iran 2 for Iraq.  . . It is wonderful that they got Zarqawi, unfortunately it will hardly put dent in the violence.  It might not even chip the paint.	0	2
Why do I keep seeing people on here 'dissing' on the soldiers in Iraq?	It depends when and where you are.  Here people respect my husband.  He is in the military.  He just got back from Iraq and about to serve another.  Maybe people don't surport the war but you should our troops.  Everyday soldiers die to make a difference.  They are following orders.	1	4
Why do I keep seeing people on here 'dissing' on the soldiers in Iraq?	Even if it hypocritical it's still true. Our soldiers in Iraq are discraseing the name of this great nation.	1	3
Why do I keep seeing people on here 'dissing' on the soldiers in Iraq?	1) There is less for Libs to criticise in Afganistan.. 2) There are far more US soldiers in Iraq.	0	2
Why don't fat people have to pay more for air travel?	I do know that certain airlines do require people over certain size limits to purchase two seats. Not to be mean, but most economy class seats are small for an average person, and if you can't fit, you just can't fit. It's probably a traveler's nightmare to have an overly large person seated next to them, and taking a portion of the already cramped space you have. But, look on bright side, if you have to buy two seats, you should get two meals.	1	4

Why does asparugus make your pee stink?	"Asparagus is filled with sulfur-containing amino acids that break down during digestion into six sulfur-containing compounds.

Why does asparugus make your pee stink?	By trying it out, do you mean:. Eat some sugar puffs. Go pee. After peeing, bend down. Place face in toilet bowl. Inhale smell of pee. Analyze pee smell in comparison to sugar puffs . Is that what you did? Foods make your pee smell different. Broccoli and asparagus make your pee smell funny and makes them extra yellow. Water makes your pee color lighter and not have much smell. Your sugar goes into your bloodstream and out through your butt. Inside the urine. Therefore, pee smells like sugar puffs if you have eaten sugar puffs. And I don't feel like I have the need to try and prove myself. I'm fine thanks, without having the need to smell my pee.	0	2

(Mat 15:8)  This people draweth nigh unto me with their mouth, and honoreth me with their lips; but their heart is far from me.. (Mat 15:9)  But in vain they do worship me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men.. (Mat 15:10)  And he called the multitude, and said unto them, Hear, and understand:. (Mat 15:11)  Not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man; but that which cometh out of the mouth, this defileth a man.. (Mat 15:12)  Then came his disciples, and said unto him, Knowest thou that the Pharisees were offended, after they heard this saying?. (Mat 15:13)  But he answered and said, Every plant, which my heavenly Father hath not planted, shall be rooted up.. (Mat 15:14)  Let them alone: they be blind leaders of the blind. And if the blind lead the blind, both shall fall into the ditch.. (Mat 15:15)  Then answered Peter and said unto him, Declare unto us this parable.. (Mat 15:16)  And Jesus said, Are ye also yet without understanding?. (Mat 15:17)  Do not ye yet understand, that whatsoever entereth in at the mouth goeth into the belly, and is cast out into the draught?. (Mat 15:18)  But those things which proceed out of the mouth come forth from the heart; and they defile the man.. (Mat 15:19)  For out of the heart proceed evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witness, blasphemies:. Mat 15:20)  These are the things which defile a man: but to eat with unwashen hands defileth not a man.	0	2

How is Catholicism not Christianity?	"Catholics trust in their good deeds to earn their way.. ""How should I witness to someone who belongs to a denomination, who I suspect isn’t trusting the Savior?"". . The most effective way to speak about the issues of eternity to a religious person is not to get sidetracked from the essentials of salvation. Upon hearing a person’s background, we may feel an obligation to speak to issues such as infant baptism, transubstantiation, etc. However, it is wise rather to build on the points of agreement between the Bible and the person’s denomination, such as the virgin birth, the cross, and so on. One point of agreement will almost certainly be the Ten Commandments. They are the key to bringing any religious person to a saving knowledge of the gospel. . . After someone is converted to Jesus Christ, the Bible will come alive and he will be led into all truth by the indwelling Holy Spirit. God’s Word will then give him light, and he will forsake religious tradition as he is led by God. While there are strong biblical arguments that may convince unregenerate people that their church’s traditions contradict Holy Scripture, there is a difficulty. Some religious people hold the teachings of their church to be on a par with, or of greater authority than, Holy Scripture. It is therefore often futile to try to convince them intellectually that their trust should be in the person of Jesus Christ, rather than in their own righteousness or in their church traditions. For this reason we should aim at the conscience, rather than the intellect. Take them through the Law of God (the Commandments) to show that they are condemned despite their works, and strongly emphasize that we are saved by grace, and grace alone, rather than by trusting in our own righteousness or religious traditions. . . If they are open to the gospel, and are interested in what God’s Word says in reference to their church’s teachings, they will listen to Scripture. For example, in Matthew 8:14 we see that Peter (whom the Roman Catholic church maintains was the first pope) was married, as were many of the other apostles (see 1 Corinthians 9:5)."	0	2

How is Catholicism not Christianity?	"Catholics are Christians. Some of their theology I disagree with but the basis is there and other Christians should recognize this.. . Romans 10:9 That if you confess with your mouth, ""Jesus is Lord,"" and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. 10 For it is with your heart that you believe and are justified, and it is with your mouth that you confess and are saved. 11 As the Scripture says, ""Anyone who trusts in him will never be put to shame."" 12 For there is no difference between Jew and Gentile--the same Lord is Lord of all and richly blesses all who call on him, 13 for, ""Everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved."""	1	4

How is Catholicism not Christianity?	"Protestants, in particular fundamentalists feel that they are the true christians, and that the Catholic church has perverted christianity into a bizarre polytheistic idol worshipping cult.  They forget, or usually don't know church history.. . Crash course in early christian history.... . Until 423 there was no ""bible"" or orthodoxy of belief....every little christian group, the Gnostics, Essenes and many others shared different views of who or what Jesus was, and used different versions of Gospels and letters.  . . Constantine ordered that the bishops make a catholic bible (ie broad in interest, appealing to the widest variety )  so they threw out the more contraversial and outrageous bits (and that's saying something !!!) edited and tried to correct inconsistencies with the included bits (and boy, did they miss a lot !!!!) came up with a canon, started persecuting heretic christians and building churches and forging relics with Constantines support.  Phew.. . As the Roman empire collapsed, what was now the Catholic church assumed a power vacuum in Rome and the pope became the de facto ruler of the former Roman Empire.  As literacy level dropped during the Dark Ages, and Latin fell out of common usage, the clergy were the only ones now with ""direct access"" to the word of god, and became incredibly powerful and rich as a result. (Remember, there was no TV back then, and a priest reading gods word to you in a language you didn't understand was a powerful thing). . The Protestant Reformation took place on several fronts with people like Calvin, Luther and Henry VIII reacting to the power and corruption of the papacy.   The Protestant movement has continued to fragment into even more faction ever since.. . However, by definition, they all worship Christ, whatever their docrtrinal differences, so they all practice Christianity.. . . The fact it is all delusion is an answer to a different question"	1	4

How is Catholicism not Christianity?	catholics practise their form of christianity. the bible condems the use of Idols, the veneration of mary,. the pomp and ceremony practised. .  REV 18:4  And I heard another voice out of heaven say: “Get out of her, my people, if YOU do not want to share with her in her sins, and if YOU do not want to receive part of her plagues. 5 For her sins have massed together clear up to heaven, and God has called her acts of injustice to mind. 6 Render to her even as she herself rendered, and do to her twice as much, yes, twice the number of the things she did; in the cup in which she put a mixture put twice as much of the mixture for her. 7 To the extent that she glorified herself and lived in shameless luxury, to that extent give her torment and mourning. For in her heart she keeps saying, ‘I sit a queen, and I am no widow, and I shall never see mourning.’ 8 That is why in one day her plagues will come, death and mourning and famine, and she will be completely burned with fire, because Jehovah God, who judged her, is strong.	1	3
How is Catholicism not Christianity?	Well... it depends on what you mean by it. Catholics are Christians, that's one of the meanings. But not all Christians are Catholics. So Catholicism isn't all of Christianity.. . As for semi-literacy on the roots of the Protestant Church... Protestants aren't the only non-Catolic Christians. Think Eastern Orthodox... And think the division of the Eastern and Western Roman Empire. No, Catholicism is not all of Christianity, by a long haul.	1	3

How is Catholicism not Christianity?	Christianity is entirely Jesus based on the BIBLE, where as Roman Catholicism is Pope based.

Christianity is revolutionary where Catholicism is evolutionary. Hopefully you get the big picture from all this.	1	4
How is Catholicism not Christianity?	Catholicism is just a branch of christianity. That being said, you should be able to figure out the answer to your second question.	1	3
How is Catholicism not Christianity?	Most consider it to be the original denomination of Christianity.  In 1054 (correct me if I'm wrong on the year), Christianity split into Catholicism and Orthodoxy.  Catholicism can come in many forms, but by far the most common is Roman Catholicism, which is headed by the Pope.  Protestant religions split from Catholicism again and again and again, with Marten Luther, John Calvin, and even Henry VIII all leading new branches of Christianity.. . I don't know what specifics you are looking for - please elaborate.	1	4
How is Catholicism not Christianity?	Catholics are Christians.  Some Protestants, attack Catholics and claim they are not true Christians because they worship Saints.  Catholics fulfill the requirement of being Christians by believing in one god and Jesus is the son of God.	1	4
How is Catholicism not Christianity?	I don't know.  You seem to have a grudge against Christianity in general and Catholicism specifically.  That may be the reason.	0	2
How is Catholicism not Christianity?	In theory, you could say, if Catholicism came from Christianity, why are there still Christians around?. . Because some people believe one thing, and others believe something else, that's why!	1	3

How is Catholicism not Christianity?	I have two words for you: Opus Dei. I have more to say: catholicism has a nasty history. and if catholicism is corrupt then so is the rest of christianity. so it makes it so much easier to watch protestants shoot themselves in the foot when they bash catholics, another sect of christianity.	0	2
How is Catholicism not Christianity?	Catholicism is basically a denomination of Christianity. It is a lot of rituals and is a very strict religion, while Christianity is meant to be a personal relationship with Christ and not a religion.. . This is not to say that there aren't Catholics who are Christians--some of my closest friends are Catholic Christians. And there are people who say they are Christians but aren't.. . I am a nondenominational Christian.	1	4
How is Catholicism not Christianity?	"Catholicism is absoulutley not original christianity!  Did Jesus say ""pray to my earthly mom""?  Or ""heres some beads to pray with""?  How about... ""mary is perfect... make rituals... works will save you...  kill anyone who doesnt follow...""?  Catholicism and the bible dont work.  Thats why priests used to tell followers not to read the bible.  Yes Jesus Christ came and died for us all... but he did not die for His people to be what the Catholic church has become.  If you believe that the Catholic Church is the original and right ... then do yourself a favor and actually read your bible."	1	3
How is Catholicism not Christianity?	you are right and wrong at the same time. I asked a question like this. They are not the same thing though Catholicism is a type of Christianity. Catholics differ from most other Christian faiths greatly though	1	3
How is Catholicism not Christianity?	"In the beginning it was coz they were no match for them and coz they worshipped ""pagan deities"".. But christianity kinda adopted some of it's practices.Constantine used christianity for political reasons.So ""some christians"" that didn't like Constantine's influence in christianity were killed and called heretics,apostates!"	0	2
How is Catholicism not Christianity?	"Catholicism is christianity (much to the dismay of non catholic christians everywhere). . . As for the why of it .. well .. as the christians are fond of saying .... the bible says so. Sorry to break it to you but the bible is very very decidedly male centric and is all in favor of ""keeping women in their place"". It has always rather amazed me that women can stomach being christian."	1	3
How is Catholicism not Christianity?	CATHOLICISM IS NOT EXACTLY CHRISTIAN.CATHOLICISM WAS FOUNDED BY CONSTANTINE WHO BROUGHT IN A VERY GECKO BABYLONIAN FORM OF WORSHIPING IDOLS AND DEAD SAINTS.. CHRISTIANS ON THE OTHER HAND WORSHIP ONLY CHRIST IN SPIRIT AND TRUTH.	1	4
How is Catholicism not Christianity?	Because Christians were Jews that believed Jesus was the savior.  Some Jews did not believe this.  They still continue to wait for the savior.  So those Jews that did believe Jesus was the savior, sected off and formed a new religion - Catholicism (Christianity).	1	4
How is Catholicism not Christianity?	"There is only one definition and meaning of Christianity. It cannot be changed.. . What is always changing is ""people's definition"" on Christianity and ""people's attitude"" towards Christianity.. . You have to understand it my dear friend."	1	3
How is Catholicism not Christianity?	"Are Catholics Christians?  They are only if Jehovah Witnesses and Mormons are, too.  Although I would not call Catholicism a cult like I would the other two, the perversions of the Gospel are just as extreme.  In one sense all three fall under the umbrella of ""Christianity,"" for all of them believe in Christ, to some extent.  However, since the New Testament states that we have no mediator between God except Christ, and Catholics have a priesthood, and pray to saints (the New Testaments states that all Christians are both saints and priests, btw), the Catholic church has more in common with Judaism than with Christianity."	1	4
How is Catholicism not Christianity?	"Christianity is the umbrella term for Catholicism and Protestant faiths. Of course this becomes difficult with the faith of the ""Born Again Christians"" who call themselves just Christians or True Christians."	1	4
How is Catholicism not Christianity?	Catholicism exists only for power and profits.. . This I believe; http://homelessheart.com/testimony.htm	1	4
How is Catholicism not Christianity?	"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholicism. . all Christian religions practise intercessory prayer...confession is just the way Catholics do it....in other churches it's called ''prayer chains'', etc.  Jesus meant for us as Christian siblings to lift each other up in prayer....it's called the ''Power of Prayer""..there is some ''over-ritualism'' in Catholicism & some get caught up in this & get distracted from the real message/redemption of Jesus Christ, but there are stumbling blocks in all Christian denominations obviously because Satan is at work hard in Christianity....it is His sworn enemy, but to call Catholicism a false religion is just ludicrous."	1	3
How is Catholicism not Christianity?	"Religion, my dear friend, is man-made... or didn't you know that?. Christianity is not a ""religion"". With religion, you have man-made rules, rituals, laws, ceremonies, etc. Some of the greatest atrocities were done in the ""name"" of Christianity, but were in fact one man's, (or one church's), hunger for power and domination. I'll bet you even think that Catholicism is Christianity? If so, I can see why you think as you do! It is one of the biggest pagan religions around! True Christians don't have a religion. Their inspiration comes from the Word of God, not man! A true Christian seeks to be as Jesus was, (and is!).. So... how much history have you studied?. (Sounds like you've already made up your mind regardless?!)"	1	3
How is Catholicism not Christianity?	Catholic are a branh of Christianity. . .             Here is a table for you.. .         CHRISTIAN.        /    l    &#92;.

How is Catholicism not Christianity?	Catholicism is a denomination within Christianity. So Catholics are Christians. Problem solved. However, your question may be more related to inter-denominational relationships. In that case, it just depends upon how different the non-Catholic person's religious perspective is in relation to Catholicism. I am not Catholic, but am married to a Catholic, and we've been together for many years.	1	3
How is Catholicism not Christianity?	there is no evidence, however have you noticed how the far right have kidnapped the debate to evolution vs Christianity , instead of Christianity evolution or Christianity literal	0	2

How is Catholicism not Christianity?	They both have the same basic belief system and worship the same thing.. The Catholics have much more dogmatic law.  And they also have the pope.  Catholicism states that the pope is a direct conduit to God and whatever he says in infallible.  The rest of Christianity thinks that's kind of ridiculous.	1	4
How is Catholicism not Christianity?	Everything evolves.  As man evolved from the apes,  Christianity evolves too.  When too many people stop believing,  Christianity has to reinvent itself or perish.	0	2

Why does'nt America regard foriegn credentials?	A lot of Americans are not familiar with foreign credentials and therefore dismiss them.  This doesn't mean that your credentials are not worth less.

Why does'nt America regard foriegn credentials?	One major reason is that there are around 200 countries in the world, many of which have different requirements.

Why does'nt America regard foriegn credentials?	The US has so many highly educated people here with degrees that are doing odd jobs.  Having a degree doesn't mean you have the necessary experience  required to perform the delegated chores associated with that profession.  EX. as a question.  Would you want a doctor with a degree but no experience operating on your back without an  experienced doctor assisting?  Of course not..    Another situation exists within this society, and that is the other side of the coin... There are so many people  with the same experience already in line for the same profession you are in, that  have the experience being looked for.   They already did their internship and the such (which are required) to be considered,   So..  a masters degree, with internship, is better than a masters degree alone!!!  Besides there are also a lot of faked documents floating around these days that are NOT verifiable... DO THE INTERNSHIP,,Prove yourself  and then   APPLY...	1	4

Why does'nt America regard foriegn credentials?	"There has been news overseas of scandals regarding national exams and the educaional systems in other countries. Remember, what makes the news is generally an isolated case, but it has been generalized to sound like common practice. At the same time, there are many different educational systems and criteria that it is hard to make comparisons. For example, as a general rule, most US universities will not consider a candidate for a Master's program if the Bachelor's was completed in less than 4 years. Countries that follow the British educational style will have spent a period of ""pre-university"" that can take up to 2 years before taking the final exams for the chosen papers. Then, completion of a Bachelor's degree takes only 3 years. To compare with the American system, we have the general education subjects before specialization tends to occur. In effect, bith systems are doing the same thing, it's a hang up about the time factor or classification of an area with which most are not familiar.. . Another idea to help keep in mind, for professional types of degrees and qualifications, each country has specific ideas as to what should be in the curriculum. For example, medical schools also empasize patient care and communication as part and parcel. Other countries medical degrees take less time as they empasize more on pathology and diagnosis. . . One more thing to remember, in the US we don't have a national standard. The US universities are independent and may not even accept credits from another US university. Many universities DO offer bridging programs where should you not meet the tradtitional requirements for a master's degree, you can apply your experience as well as take a few subjects you lack to re-evaluate your situation. Thos means you won't have to repeat everything - just fill in the gaps in your education that do not meet the standards of a particular university."	0	2

Why does'nt America regard foriegn credentials?	"Welcome to the Catch-22 of education and educated people.  It gets worse, you can be credited/certified in one State, but not another without ""further"" testing and courses.  Then Standards differ from not just one State to the next, but from one place of higher learning to another.  There may be ""universal precautions"" with AIDS, but there is nothing universally accepted about education; experience or abilities.  I believe its called ""hoop-jumping"" and it is still a waste of human potential and knowledge.  Good luck to you and don't quit pursuing your dreams."	0	1
Why does'nt America regard foriegn credentials?	Standards vary from country to country. If i went to Italy although a CPA in the US, I could not immediately be employed at the same level. Do the internship, show what you got, my experience is that people outside the US have a far superior education than those here; but you have to prove it first.	1	4
Why does'nt America regard foriegn credentials?	You think other countries accept American credentials?  I doubt it, unless they're desperate for a specific type of professional.. . Each country has different building materials and cultural and natural challenges.  If you're education is close enough to US standards, you should be able to quickly apply what you've learned in an internship (and make good $$$ while doing it, too!)  The the certification should be a breeze for you.	1	3
Why does'nt America regard foriegn credentials?	I think maybe the question might be a little off.  In your particular position it might be true but in honesty in lots of positions such as doctors, they will usually be hired quicker than Americans as usually they will work cheaper although still making great wages.  Locally here, a J-1 doctor with no experience will hire in as soon as they enter the country for about 150K per year with another 100k in perks where an American doctor won't even consider an offer like that.  I saw a couple years back an American OBGYN hire in at a company with a 200K sign in bonus, $200K per year salary, 1/2 of the overall money she generated on top of that, $500/month cell phone allowance, and $700/month rental allowance.	1	4

Why does'nt America regard foriegn credentials?	The term High Church is used to differentiate the various factions of the Church of England (nothing to do with the americans at all ). The High Wing is that section that relates to Roman Catholic thinking and practise whereas the low wing is evangelical and does not regard the role of priesthood and ritual with great fondness. . The High Church or Anglo-Catholic faction is almost identical in dogma and worship as their Roman Catholic cousins and though many regard the Pontiff with affection, do not regard Him as having any authority over them (though it doesn't stop them copying and adopting every known Roman Catholic practise!)Contrary to the questioner, most High Church membership is concentrated in the South and West of England..

Why did the founder of Daewoo get a 10-year jail sentence?	Punishment can be used for several purposes. . Traditionally, in the US, punishment has been used as a form of deterrance. (i.e. someone commits a crime and gets sentenced to 20 years, the public see's this and the cost of the crime [the jailing] outweighs the benefit of the crime, which hopefully deters criminals to commit that same crime). There is General deterrance and specific deterrance. General detterance is following a chart of crimes and punishments. By this I mean there is determinant sentencing for each crime, no questions asked. . Specific sentencing is where the prosecution individualized each criminal. By this I mean that the person recieved indeterminate sentencing or perhaps makes a plea bargain. . The US is becoming more and more recognized for using both methods of punishment.	0	2

Why did the founder of Daewoo get a 10-year jail sentence?	Gladerade is correct:. . Felony - Can be punished by incarceration more than a year.  The typingig and classing of felonies varies from state to state.. . Misdemeanor - Maximum possible sentence less than a year.  Of course commiting a misdemeanor and being convicted of one does not necessarily mean a person will do any jail time.  May get community service and a fine, for example for many low level misdemeanors.  The classification is based on maximum possible sentence.. . An offence or violation (i.e. most traffic infractions) are not misdemeanors or felonies and thus are NOT crimes.  So if you have a job application asking you whether you have been convicted of a crime and you have an 80 mph in a 65 zone on your record, etc., you can truthfully answer NO.	0	1

Why did the founder of Daewoo get a 10-year jail sentence?	Daewoo Motor Company in Korea was placed under the control of the Korean bankruptcy courts in late 2000.. . In 2002 a new company, GM-Daewoo Auto and Technology was created, part owned by Daewoo Motor Company's creditor banks, part owned by GM-Holden (the Australian arm of General Motors), part owned by Suzuki and part owned by Shanghai Automotive Industries Corporation. This company took over two of the three Daewoo Motor factories in Korea, plus one in Vietnam, and the Bupyong Technical Center, and did a deal to continue to buy cars from the other factory (also at Bupyong) in Korea. It has since bought the Bupyong factory too.. The European distribution system for Daewoo was dismantled, and a new one created by GM-Europe.. . The cars are now badged Chevrolet for most export markets including Europe (although Suzuki, Pontiac, Buick and Holden badges are used on certain models in some other countries). The Daewoo name is still used in Korea.. . So, to answer your question, the company is not Chevrolet but, in Europe, its cars are Chevrolets.. .

why do wisdom varies from person to person?

Wisdom (learning from others' mistakes and triumphs) is preferred, but rarely taken especially by yonger people. Some never learn to do that. . . Sitting by and watching is tough. But sometimes it is what must be done.. . Perhaps having an ""authority figure"" talk to your friend will help, if you feel it difficult to approach it yourself."	1	4

why do wisdom varies from person to person?	I think it is a great. idea.  so you should start doing it, producing movies and tv shows without using makeup.  the conventional wisdom is that under the harsh lights, it washes out a person's features....but i'm with you.	0	2
why do wisdom varies from person to person?	As you already know, we are all unique. Aside from the dna and genes inside from our parents and ancestors, every life lived is different. Our experiences vary, our perception of those experiences vary. Through our experiences we form new perceptions and views of the world. Every person we encounter, every event we've experienced, every thought in our head creates who we are. Our own 'uniqueness' is developed over a life time, depending on you belief system it is also developed through the lives we have each previously led. Some believe that we carry inside our spirit wisdom and lessons from past lives that assist us in our present lifetime. Kind of like Bill Murray in the movie Groundhogs Day, how he kept reliving the day over and over until he got it right, we continue to live lives, learn lessons, gather the wisdom and allow it to perfect who we are to become.	1	4

why do wisdom varies from person to person?	"Nice question. I think that wisdom is a specific type of knowlege that is highly applicable and helpful in practical situations. Knowledge is a broad category of all of the truths that a person can intellectually understand. I see wisdom as the smaller set of psychological or philosophical truths that one has gained, usually through experience. Wisdom is the knowledge of uncommon truth(s) that directly influences one's thoughts, feelings, and actions.. . I guess I believe this because of how frequently the word ""wise"" is associated with an old person who acts and thinks differently than other people because he has a greater understanding of the nature of things around him. The stereotypical example would be someone like Gandalf or Dumbledore."	1	4
why do wisdom varies from person to person?	Imho, wisdom is _applied_ knowledge, or knowledge in action.. .

Then I gain much wisdom by learning from those experiences.	0	2
why do wisdom varies from person to person?	Well, personally, I would say pray for wisdom just as King Solomon did. If Jehovah chooses to grant you wisdom then you can help yourself and every one around you..   On the other Hand I think miracle days ended with the death pf John the last Apostle on the Island of Patmos..   So no miracles, well, find one person to be kind to and tell that person they are obliged to pass KINDNESS on to the next person.  Maybe some day a stranger will be kind to me and I will owe that to you starting the trend!	0	2

Try talking to the teacher.  Tell them that you are good and you don't understand why you get punished with the bad kids.  . . If you aren't willing to do that, then there's a good chance you aren't as good as you claim to be.	1	3

How can I heat the water within a 150 gal tank that's open to the atmosphere in Feb.?	Think energy. What you want to do is maximize the energy gain, and at the same time minimize the loss. There are several things that you can do. For example:. - Paint the tank black on the outside, so that it will absorb the maximum amount of sunlight. . - Paint the tank silver on the inside, so that it will reflect as much heat as possible as it tries to escape the water.. - Insulate the tank to prevent heat from escaping the water.. - If you have control over the shape, make it as flat as possible, to maximize the surface area, again, to catch as much sunlight as you can.. - If you are willing to spend money on energy, you can heat it with gas, electricity, or both. In this case, heavy insulation on the outside is an absolute must, especially in the middle of winter, or you will lose a lot of cash.... . Hope this helps. Cheers.	1	4

How can I heat the water within a 150 gal tank that's open to the atmosphere in Feb.?	I assume you are dealing with a hot water tank rather than an instant-on hot water heater, and assuming there is no unusual pressure build-up in your hot water pipes.  The tank is pressurized, however, as the water heats  the hot water expands and this creates increased pressure within the tank.  As the water flows out of the tank, this pressure is released, thereby the presure in the tank goes down.  As hot water flows out of the tank, cold water flows in to replace it, and cooler water adds to reducing the pressure build-up.	1	3

In some cases, the water might have entered your exhaust system.  Which means you have to open your exhaust sys to warm the engine to operating temperature.  Once the car is running you can then reconnect your exhaust and blow the water out of it.. . Good Luck	0	1

Leave in tank about 20 minutes to adjust to the same temperature but then you should go another step...open bag and gradually add fish tank water to bag about 1/4 cup at a time every 3-5 minutes until bag is pretty full...this will help new fish adjust to the PH levels of the fishtank.  Then, rather than dumping fish in from the bag, use a net and get them out and add to tank.  Dispose of water in bag because you don't want to introduce other water (from pet store) into tank.	0	1

How can I heat the water within a 150 gal tank that's open to the atmosphere in Feb.?	"by just letting the tanks ""run"" for a week or so isnt really doing anything-you need the fish and the waste in the tank to grown the bacteria bed you need or by some thing from the pet store to ""grow"" bacteria. However, and I dont care who disagrees-I did this for all my customers in my store and it never failed me---when you want to buy fish, ask the dealer to give you a couple of bags of the ""water""  in the tank and siphon some of the dirt from the gravel--this is the already grown bacteria and will give you a head start providing the tank isn't infected at the time.   I have set up fresh water and salt water tanks from 10 gal to 125 gal and seldom lost a fish. Like I said, most people wont agree but it never failed me and I always save some in my tank if I ever decide to strip it down but all I do is once in a whihle, remove 3/4 of the water and fill her up again after I vacuum the gravel."	0	2

Another trick would be not to have the tank near a window.  Sunlight will heat the water if allowed to shine on the tank.. . If you need to take the temp down quickly, start adding some ice cubes to the water... not a lot all at once... just a few at a time so the fish can adjust to the change slowly.	0	2
How can I heat the water within a 150 gal tank that's open to the atmosphere in Feb.?	In addition to bubbles from pouring the water in, there are gases dissolved in the water and they tend to collect on the side of the tank as small bubbles. The bubbles will usually be focused on areas of the tank wall that have more texture -- algae, or near the waterline.. . It's not a problem, but to make them go away, I usually swipe over the wall of the tank a few hours after a water change.	0	2

How can I get a cork out of, not into, a wine bottle without a corkscrew?	Unfold the worm (corkscrew part) completely and partly open the lever parallel to the worm. Insert the worm into the cork and begin to turn.  As the screw drives into the cork, the notch in the lever should rest on the lip of the bottle.  Keep turning until the worm is completely in the cork.  Make sure the lever is between you and the bottle, and pull back towards you gently.  Once you get the hang of it, you'll never use another fancy device again!	0	2
How can I get a cork out of, not into, a wine bottle without a corkscrew?	A decanter is a glass bottle with a small glass cork, it's usually used for liquor.  A carafe has an open top (with no lid) and is used for wine.	0	2
How can I get a cork out of, not into, a wine bottle without a corkscrew?	I'm a Southern European so wine is part of my culture. This has happened to me plenty of times, try pushing the cork in, instead of trying to pull it out.  If it's a regular wine bottle (either local or a standard import as opposed to a high-end import) the cork should be 35 mm long and pose no problem.	1	4
How can I get a cork out of, not into, a wine bottle without a corkscrew?	If you have a syringe, you can push it through the cork to the inside of the bottle. Press the air into the bottle and the pressure inside will force the cork out.	1	3
How can I get a cork out of, not into, a wine bottle without a corkscrew?	You smell the cork. If it smells funny or corky, the cork has probably gone bad and, if the cork has gone bad, so likely has the wine.	0	2
How can I get a cork out of, not into, a wine bottle without a corkscrew?	"Just because there was no discoloration or growth along the top of the cork does not mean that it isn't possible that the cork hasn't caused a problem with the wine, or that there isn't some other problem. It is useful to smell the end of the cork before drinking the wine. Sometimes it will give you advance notice that there is something wildly off about the wine, including that the wine may be ""corked."" It is not considered unusual that a cork will periodically fail to do its job."	0	2

How can I get a cork out of, not into, a wine bottle without a corkscrew?	If you paid a lot for the wine, and the stores are still open,, It would benefit you to run and get one! They are cheap! . . Because,, you will get bits of cork in your bottle, and it takes forever to get it opened w/out one...and it use to take me forever with one,, so i can imagine that it would be easier just to go and get one.. you could be back by the time you would have it out. . I hate that you have a problem w/ your wine... it is to be enjoyed...not a problem type thing.	0	2
How can I get a cork out of, not into, a wine bottle without a corkscrew?	almost impossible.  You could try to pull it out with a  screw driver.	1	3

How can I get a cork out of, not into, a wine bottle without a corkscrew?	totally busted man! but if the cork is a must out heres what to do. a plactic cork is an easy fix(real cork has a tendency to break apart) if you can use a screw to pull it back out great, to easy. however that wont always do it and the only solution is to push the cork all the way in. now if you want the wine back in the bottle without a cork floating around in it its tricky. you can drain the wine and if you posses a rare skill you can actually pull a cork out of a bottle using a cloth napkin. noone belives that is possible but ive won alot of free drinks showing this one!	1	4
How can I get a cork out of, not into, a wine bottle without a corkscrew?	it's old-fashioned, and really rather pointless, but some old folks and afficionados like to sniff the cork to allegedly sense the notes in the wine. this is changing, though, since more and more wines are no longer using corks.	0	1
How can I get a cork out of, not into, a wine bottle without a corkscrew?	"If you are desperate, break the top off and pour through two layers of T-shirt, to avoid swallowing glass slivers. If it is a red, the stain will never come out, but you can tell people it is blood.. . If you have a wire coat hanger and a pair of pliers, you can make a cork puller. I use mine when the cork breaks off too deep for the corkscrew to reach.. . Cut a straight length of the wire. Bend one end at right angles, then again. You want a ""J"" with two right angles instead of a curve, and a very long body. The bent part should be about half the diameter of the cork.. . Slide the bent part down between the cork and the bottle neck, then turn it so the end is in the center of the cork. Wrap the other end of the wire around the pliers, to give you a handle. Pull.. . I made a wooden handle for mine, but I use it once or twice a year and keep it in the kitchen drawer with the corkscrew.. . You can get a Swiss Army knife with a corkscrew and 6 other handy blades for less than $20. You are worth it. Spring for it."	1	4
How can I get a cork out of, not into, a wine bottle without a corkscrew?	You can use a pen or something to CAREFULLY drill a hole into the cork so that air can get out and then hammer the cork into the bottle if you are desperate to open it and have nothing else...?	1	4
How can I get a cork out of, not into, a wine bottle without a corkscrew?	i was told by someone in the business that actually, the cork should be pressed with your thumb, as this will tell if the cork was set right in the bottle. If it is hard and brittle, you will most likely have a bad bottle. This makes sense to me as sniffing the cork offers much less information than sniffing the boquet from a proper glass.	0	2
How can I get a cork out of, not into, a wine bottle without a corkscrew?	Ostensibly, an honored guest is supposed to sniff the cork in order to make sure the hasn't turned to vinegar in the bottle.  The server will only pour glasses after receiving approval.. . In reality, most of us wouldn't know vinegar from vintage, at least not from the cork alone.  It would have to be pretty obvious.  Nevertheless, the practice has become part of the ritual of serving red wine.  Nobody really expects you to be an expert.. . What may be more important to know is whether or not the red wine has been decanted.  This means the wine has been carefully poured from the original bottle into a new container.  The bitter sediments should be left behind in the original bottle.	0	2
How can I get a cork out of, not into, a wine bottle without a corkscrew?	If you don't have a cork screw then use a screw that is longer than the cork and a pare of pliers	1	4
What is the importance of absolute zero temperature?	Absolute zero is important because it is very likely to be the lowest temperate possible, and is most likely unobtainable. Knowing it is useful because it makes calculations involving temperature simple to deal with. Personally I wouldn't want to try anything like quantum thermodynamics using celcius or fahrenheit because the temperatures below zero would most likely turn out to be a lot tougher to deal with.	1	4
What is the importance of absolute zero temperature?	By definition, at absolute zero, nothing is moving.. . Temperature is the measure of the average kinetic energy of the particles of a system.  At absolute Zero (0 K), the partciles have stopped completely.  If all the particples have stopped, there is not way that it is going to move up/down/side to side since if it did, it would have some temperature ad thus not be at absolute zero.	1	4
What is the importance of absolute zero temperature?	Its near absolute zero, at about 3 kelvin. This is some of the only evidence that the Big Bang happened, because it is theorized that the slight temperature is energy left over universe wide from the explosion. Otherwise, it would be absolute zero...theoretically.	1	4
What is the importance of absolute zero temperature?	No, because 0C is simply the freezing point of water.  It's an artificial zero point, picked because it's convenient for humans on Earth.  The absolute zero point (called, appropriately, absolute zero) is -273.15 C, or 273.15 degrees below the temperature water freezes.  Absolute zero has very specific thermodynamic properties - it is the temperature where atoms have the minimum molecular vibration, which defines heat.  It's too complicated to describe here - suggest you check the reference.. . Anyway, looking at temperatures from absolute zero, all temperatures are positive.  Also, every element (and compound) has its own thermodynamic characteristics, including melting point, boiling point, and freezing point.  So Fluorine has a boiling point that is 85.15 degrees above absolute zero, water has a boiling point that is 373.15 degrees above absolute zero, and iron (for example) has a boiling point that is 3134 degrees above absolute zero.. . Which simply means that on Earth, Florine in its natural state is always a gas.	1	3
What is the importance of absolute zero temperature?	First of all, entropy is a relative term and is not absolute. So, we can't measure entropy but only change in entropy can be measured. It is a measure of disorder. If the disorder is decreased, then we can have a negative entropy change. Disorder decreases with a decrease in tempearture. But if we consider the whole universe, though there is a decrease in temperature at one particular point, there will be increase in temperature at other points. So, you will always see a positive change in entropy. According to third law of thermodynamics, change in entropy would be zero only at absolute temperature. And we can not attain absolute zero temperature as there would be temperature corresponding to zero point energy associated with the atoms. That is the reason why we can attain hundredth of a Kelvin but not absolute zero. In order for the change in entropy to be negative, you have to go below absolute zero which is not possible. At absolute zero, atoms won't move which means that everything is ordered and the change in entropy is zero.	1	4
What is the importance of absolute zero temperature?	"Water does in fact ""boil"" at 100C. or 210F. However, it evaporates at all temperatures that it is unstable. Anything from absolute zero up."	0	2
What is the importance of absolute zero temperature?	The temperature of space in the Universe is about -454 degrees Fahrenheit, about 2.728 degrees above absolute zero. This temperature is what's left of the temperature generated when the Big Bang occurred (greater than 1.8^13 degrees Fahrenheit)	0	1
What is the importance of absolute zero temperature?	At -240C it is extremely cold, enough to reduce our atmosphere to a liquid and only 30 degrees above the theoretical coldest temperature possible: -273.15, or 'absolute zero'	1	3
What is the importance of absolute zero temperature?	absolute zero is not important in everyday life but if i were a scientst trying to develop an extremly powerful computer chip and it ran most efficiently at absolute zero i would be most interested in obtaining that information. But since it is not important in everyday life you should not care yourself.	0	2
What is the importance of absolute zero temperature?	kelvin is an absolute scale, which means it has meaning. Celsius says water freezes at zero degrees, while every one knows it freezes at 32 degrees. or maybe not? there is also degrees reamur. absolute zero, in degrees kelvin, is non-attainable, because a number of physical variants are infinite at that temperature.	1	3
What is the importance of absolute zero temperature?	As the temperature is lowered, the temperature heads more and more towards absolute zero. The third law of thermodynamics states that as temperature approaches more and more towards absolute zero, the system will head towards no entropy. Since a solid has less entropy than water, the liquid water heads to solid at low temperature.	1	4
What is the importance of absolute zero temperature?	LaL is correct. when dealing with freezing points that approach absolute zero (-273) you must use the kelvin scale for recording temp. The Kelvin scale is a thermodynamic (absolute) temperature scale where absolute zero—the lowest possible temperature where nothing could be colder and no heat energy remains in a substance—is defined as zero kelvin (0 K). The unit increment of the Kelvin scale is the kelvin (symbol: K), which is the SI unit of temperature and is one of the seven SI base units. The unit “kelvin” and its scale by international agreement, defined by two points: absolute zero, and the triple point of specially prepared (VSMOW) water. This definition also precisely relates the Kelvin scale to the Celsius scale. Absolute zero—the temperature at which nothing could be colder and no heat energy remains in a substance—is defined as being precisely 0 K and −273.15 °C. The triple point of water is defined as being precisely 273.16 K and 0.01 °C	1	3
What is the importance of absolute zero temperature?	"Most gases have negative boiling points (and melting points). zero degrees celsius isn't ""absolute zero"". It's just the point at which water freezes.. . Flourine freezes way below the freezing point of water, as does oxygen, carbon dioxide, helium, hydrogen, etc"	0	2
What is the importance of absolute zero temperature?	"Because of the weak interatomic forces, helium remains liquid down to absolute zero; helium solidifies only under great pressure. Solid helium requires a temperature of 1–1.5 K and about 26 standard atmospheres (2.6 MPa) of pressure. At sufficiently low temperature, both helium-3 and helium-4 undergo a transition to a superfluid phase. Superfluidity is a phase of matter characterised by the complete absence of viscosity (measure of the resistance of a fluid to deform under shear stress. It is commonly perceived as ""thickness"", or resistance to pouring). Thus superfluids, placed in a closed loop, can flow endlessly without friction.. . But getting a temperature of 1 - 1.5k is not possible outside of a laboratory, so in THEORY, it can roll uphill. Absolute Zero is not possible on earth, because of interaction between molecules in the atmosphere."	1	3
What is the importance of absolute zero temperature?	temperature is measured in several measuring methods, farenheit, ceslcius, and kelvin.  high and low are dependent on the presence of molecular motion. only kelvin deals in an absolute temperature. 0 degrees kelvin, is equal to absolute zero. there is no known chemical which has achieved that degree of cold, that I know of, but a chemist may disagree.	1	3
What is the importance of absolute zero temperature?	Maybe here on earth absolute zero temperature  (-274c) is'nt posible to achieve just yet; but I'm sure that in the fardest region of space, were no visible light source or infrared light or any form of heat is within millions of light year distance, absolute zero must be present and anything within this dead freeze would be motionless, all the way down to atoms and quarks.	0	2
What is the importance of absolute zero temperature?	"THE LAWS OF THERMODYNAMICS--. . In thermodynamics, there are four laws of very general validity, and as such they do not depend on the details of the interactions or the systems being studied. Hence, they can be applied to systems about which one knows nothing other than the balance of energy and matter transfer. Examples of this include Einstein's prediction of spontaneous emission around the turn of the 20th century and current research into the thermodynamics of black holes.. . The four laws are:. . Zeroth law of thermodynamics, stating that thermodynamic equilibrium is an equivalence relation. . If two thermodynamic systems are in thermal equilibrium with a third, they are also in thermal equilibrium with each other. . . First law of thermodynamics, about the conservation of energy . The increase in the energy of a closed system is equal to the amount of energy added to the system by heating, minus the amount lost in the form of work done by the system on its surroundings. . . Second law of thermodynamics, about entropy . The total entropy of any isolated thermodynamic system tends to increase over time, approaching a maximum value. . . Third law of thermodynamics, about absolute zero temperature . As a system asymptotically approaches absolute zero of temperature all processes virtually cease and the entropy of the system asymptotically approaches a minimum value. . . This law is more clearly stated as: ""the entropy of a perfectly crystalline body at absolute zero temperature is zero."""	0	2
What is the importance of absolute zero temperature?	As said before.  Heat is simply a measure of how fast molecules are vibrating.  The less vibrations the colder something gets.  At -273 degrees celsius (absolute zero) molecules stop moving all together.	0	2
What is the importance of absolute zero temperature?	"To reach absolute zero, there has to be an object of lower temperature, which could ""steal"" the heat from the cooled object. So, spontaneous reaching of absolute zero is not possible.. . If using a kind of refrigeration, there also has to be a  material that has lower temperature than the cooled one, to get the heat from it.. . Thermodynamically speaking, the second law says that entropy can't go down witout some work applied. To achieve absolute zero, an enormous work would have to be applied, but in working conditions that could disable it (around 0K all motions stop or are extremely slow). On the other hand, every work produces some losses of energy, that are transformed into heat. So, while lowering the temperature, the device would produce some heat, and thus ""denying"" it's own function by rising the temperature."	1	4
What is the importance of absolute zero temperature?	Absolute zero is defined as the temperature at which all molecular motion ceases. More precisely though, it is when molecular motion reaches a minimum, because quantum effects guarantee there will still be a little bit of fuzziness in the position of the particles.. . Electrons, for example, do not collapse into the nucleus at absolute zero because they can only exist in certain well-defined, or quantized, energy levels.	1	4
What is the importance of absolute zero temperature?	Heat is vibration of particles, but the catalyst for making those particles vibrate can be many things, from friction to chemical. One such catalyst, light, is constantly passing through almost every area of the universe at all times, and when this light impacts matter, heat results. However this heat is irrelevant to our conversation, because your asking about empty space (which is almost impossible to find and/or create). The fact is this:. How do we know the temperature of an area of space, or more accurately how far from absolute zero it is, without introducing some piece of matter that is designed to determine the information we seek? The introduction of such a device would receive impacts from the light passing through said space field, corrupting the temperature reading.. The point of this is that empty space does have a temperature close to ab zero (not ab zero due to dark energy radiating heat), empty space is an improbable eventuality, and if it did or does ever happen no-one will be there to observe it. besides that, space is not empty and thus is not ab zero. . as a side note, particles are a vibration of impure energy, and are only seen because the energy is moving at the speed of light giving the illusion that it is material. Therefore, even matter is just space that is not empty, and thus is not ab zero.	1	4
What is the importance of absolute zero temperature?	All materials at temperatures above absolute zero have some resistance to the flow or movement of electrons through the material, even the materials that compose the battery. All materials are swimming pools of electrons and nuclei that get in the way of the electrons traveling from one end of the battery to the other, and since the positive end of the battery is taking in electrons all the time, and the negitive end is pouring out electrons all the time, there must be electrons traveling in the battery from the positive end to the negative end, each one dodging the structural crowd of electrons and nuclei that make up the battery (the material of the battery).	1	4
What is the importance of absolute zero temperature?	"The theory behind absolute zero is that ""All matter ceases to exist"" The molecules or atomic structures break down. When this happens you no longer have matter. No matter means that you have nothing. To reach absolute zero you simply have to keep cooling the substance. Cooling in this phrase means removing all the energy as possible."	1	4
What is the importance of absolute zero temperature?	The heat makes the molecules go faster, so it probably the cause of the solubility increase.. . Heat is nothing more than molecules speeding up. We call these molecules heat molecules. If the molecules slow down, stuff gets colder. That's why scientists can make the temperature one millionth of a Kelvin (a temperature scale) away from Absolute Zero. At absolute zero, nothing moves. No movement. Nothing.. . This is why when molecules heat up, it becomes faster because there is more energy. If molecules went fast enough, something might just burn. This is how we have the sun and fire and heat. . . Anyway, I hope this helps!	1	4
What is the importance of absolute zero temperature?	Because there would have to be absolutely no heat anywhere... even in empty space, there are still billions and billions of stars around the empty space creating heat.  Therefore, it could be a billionth of a degree but never absolute zero.	0	2

Getting married is no more gross than that.  Face it, it is discrimination to not allow them to get married.  Gay's kids actually tend to turn out better than many non-gay parents' kids.  Also, it is not a proven fact that gay parents produce gay kids, so any comparison between incest and gay should be squashed.  Multiple partner marriage, I don't understand why that isn't legal either.  Soudns like a playa hayta to me.  If you can have a domestic partner by law, you should be able to marry as long as they are of age.	0	1

How can I develop leanbody and muscles?	Your muscles strain to lift the weight and get tiny tears in the tissue (muscle soreness).  This heals and the muscle gets stronger.  This is why a pro tells you to skip a day between muscle groups for the max effect.	0	2
How can I develop leanbody and muscles?	Because you are actually traumatizing your muscles, getting each muscle to contract and decontract.  They actually grow new tissue in order to compensate for the new usage of the muscle.  Hence, they get bigger	0	2
How can I develop leanbody and muscles?	White tuna is the white swim muscle of the fish, like white flight muscle on a chicken. Dark muscle is from other parts of the tuna and is more bitter.	0	1
How can I develop leanbody and muscles?	Get yourself a fat body index meter.  Up your muscle mass.  Abs will appear once fat is reduced and muscles get defined.  The more muscle mass you have, the better.	1	4
How can I develop leanbody and muscles?	Eyelid twitches/spasms are generally caused by muscle fatigue.  It may be due to eye strain from such conditions as poor lighting, lack of sleep, undiagnosed vision problem or a need for a new lens prescription.  Potassium, as in bananas, is a better treatment for muscle spasms (and cramping) than calcium because while calcium helps regulate muscle contraction, potassium helps regulate both muscle contraction AND muscle excitability.	0	1
How can I develop leanbody and muscles?	Every muscle has a different recovery cycle which is unique to each muscle and each individual.  The recovery cycle of large muscle groups is typically longer than smaller muscle groups.  Two individuals with the same build may have very different recovery cycles so it is very unique depending on individual physiology.	0	2
How can I develop leanbody and muscles?	Two reasons:  (1) When you do any type of workout, your muscles produce lactic acid.  Your muscles get irritated by it and it takes a while for your body to get rid of it.  To help get rid of it faster, stretch post-workout and drink more water.  (2) When too much stress is applied to muscles -- particularly when doing weight/strength training -- the muscles develop microscopic tears in the fibers.  When the fibers get torn it irritates the nerve endings in the tissue until your body repairs the tears, which can take one or two days.	0	2
How can I develop leanbody and muscles?	Getting rid of soreness for me means stretching and using heat directly on the muscles.  Stretching sore muscles is good because it allows fresh blood to flow into the muscles bringing them oxygen and other nutrients needed to recover.  Heat is good because it relaxes your muscles and loosens them up.	1	3
How can I develop leanbody and muscles?	Muscle pain is the number one side effect.  This happens from muscle breakdown, the medical term is rhabdomyolysis.  To know if you are having this side effect, generally you will have muscle pain, most notably in the larger muscles in the legs and also have dark urine which contains the breakdown products of the muscle.  This would be the most serious side effect to watch for.	1	4
How can I develop leanbody and muscles?	Any kind of cardio exercise (running, walking, biking, swimming, etc.). . Doing crunches and sit-ups will build muscle, and muscle burns fat.	1	3
How can I develop leanbody and muscles?	men have more muscle and just having more muscle burns calories and burning calories creates body heat	0	2
How can I develop leanbody and muscles?	Tendons connect muscles to bones. For example, your Achilles' tendon connects your foot to your calf muscles. Ligaments, on a side note, connect muscles to other muscles.	0	2
How can I develop leanbody and muscles?	As a former ballet dancer, I highly recommend Winsor Pilates. Pilates strengthens your muscles, and keeps them slim, not bulky. Pilates was developed to help injured athletes recover, so it is very constructive. Just 20 minutes a day, twice a week, after a about a month or less, will leave you with a noticeable difference in your abs.	1	4
How can I develop leanbody and muscles?	Resistance training - sometimes called weight training or strength training - is a method of conditioning designed to increase muscle strength, muscle endurance and muscle power. What happens with your muscles when it lifts or pushes something that it is not accustom to is that micro tears happen in the muscle fiber. In 72 hours, these tears get fixed by scar tissue which allows the muscle to increase the amount it can lift / push. That is why your muscles grow and get stronger with weight training, there is more scar tissue there.	1	4
How can I develop leanbody and muscles?	because muscle weights more than fat, you are replacing fat with muscle. You will lower your body fat and shrink in sizes.	0	2

how for is saturn from the sun?	The Planetary Hours are an ancient system in which one of the seven traditional naked eye planets is given rulership over each day and various parts of the day. Monday is always the Day of the Moon. Tuesday is the day of Mars, Wednesday is ruled by Mercury, Thursday is Jupiter's day, Friday is the day of Venus, Saturday is the day of Saturn, and Sunday is the day of the Sun.. . Each planetary day begins at sunrise, and ends at the next day's sunrise. For example, Sunrise on Saturday is the beginning of the day of Saturn. Before sunrise on Saturday, you are still under the day of Venus.. . The day is divided into two parts; the day (time between sunrise and sunset) and the night (time between sunset and tomorrow's sunrise). Each part of the day is then divided into 12 equal parts, for a total of 24 (unequal) hours.. . The first planetary hour of the day is always the same as the planetary day; so sunrise on Monday is the beginning of both the day of the Moon and the hour of the Moon. The hours repeat infinitely in this order:. . *Saturn. *Jupiter. *Mars. *Sun. *Venus. *Mercury. *Moon. . . So the second planetary hour of the day of the Moon is the hour of Saturn, the third would be the hour of Jupiter, and so on.	0	2

how for is saturn from the sun?	"Yes.  It is visible due to the way sunspots move on the surface. It rotates about once a month.. . [modified below for more info]. Here is a reference for you to verify the answer above.. . ""The Sun does indeed rotate. Galileo noted this nearly 400 years ago when he observed sunspots. As you can see from this animation, the apparent motion of the sunspots can be used to determine the rotation speed of the Sun."". http://curious.astro.cornell.edu/question.php?number=615. . Here's link to a short animation showing the rotation, http://collections.ic.gc.ca/universe/sun.html. . Another reference,. ""Does the Sun rotate?. Indeed it does, but unlike the Earth or other solid bodies, the gaseous bulk of the Sun rotates faster at its equator than at its poles."" http://www.astronomycafe.net/qadir/q111.html. . Finally, from NASA's ""Ask an Astrophysicist"" archive,. ""Yes, the Sun does rotate. We can observed this by observing sunspots. All sunspots move across the face of the Sun. This motion is part of the general rotation of the Sun on its axis. Observations also indicate that the Sun does not rotate as a solid body, but it spins differentially. That means that it rotates faster at the equator of the Sun and slower at its poles. (The gas giants Jupiter and Saturn also have differential rotation.) The movements of the sunspots indicate that the Sun rotates once every 27 days at the equator, but only once in 31 days at the poles."" http://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/ask_astro/answers/970108a.html"	0	2

What is a nucleus?	Nucleus: in physics, the extremely dense central core of an atom.. . Atomic nuclei are composed of two types of particles, protons and neutrons, which are collectively known as nucleons. A proton is simply the nucleus of an ordinary hydrogen atom, the lightest atom, and has a unit positive charge. A neutron is an uncharged particle of about the same mass as the proton. The number of protons in a given nucleus is the atomic number of that nucleus and determines which chemical element the nucleus will constitute when surrounded by electrons.. . The total number of protons and neutrons together in a nucleus is the atomic mass number of the nucleus. Two nuclei may have the same atomic number but different mass numbers, thus constituting different forms, or isotopes, of the same element. The mass number of a given isotope is the nearest whole number to the atomic weight of that isotope and is approximately equal to the atomic weight (in the case of carbon-12, exactly equal).. . .

What is a nucleus?	An organ at the center of an organism that gives out codes for genetics called DNA (which i'm sure you-ve heard of)	1	3
What is a nucleus?	"The nucleus serves as the cell’s command center, sending directions to the cell to grow, mature, divide, or die. It also houses DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid), the cell’s hereditary material. The nucleus is surrounded by a membrane called the nuclear envelope, which protects the DNA and separates the nucleus from the rest of the cell. The nucleus contains most of the cell’s genetic material.. . The nucleus is a dark structure located in the middle of the cell. It controls the cell's activities, and acts like the cell's brain. Inside the nucleus there is DNA which contains genetic information. The cytoplasm is a jelly-like substance inside the cell where most of the cell's activities take place. It's made out of water and other chemicals. All cell parts, except the nucleus, are located in the cytoplasm.. . Kinds of nucleus : . . Bose-Einstein nucleus (2 kinds, 11 facts) - Nucleus of even A-number (i.e., those with integral spin) (cf. Fermi-Dirac nuclei). Bose-Einstein nuclei do not obey the exclusion principle, and their ground state has zero angular momentum. . . deuteron (6 facts) (d) - The nucleus of deuterium, an isotope of hydrogen. It consists of one proton and one neutron bound together., The nucleus of a deuterium atom. md = 2.01355 amu..  . even-odd nucleus (3 facts) - Nucleus that contain even numbers of protons but odd numbers of neutrons. . . Fermi-Dirac nuclei (2 facts) - Nuclei of odd A-number (i.e., nuclei that do not have integral spin) (cf. Bose-Einstein nuclei). Fermi-Dirac nuclei therefore obey the exclusion principle (q.v.). . . isomer (2 facts) - Nucleus with the same A and Z numbers but in different energy states. . . isotone (2 facts) - Nucleus with the same number of neutrons but with different A and Z numbers. . . isotope (3 facts) - An atomic nucleus having the same number of protons as a more commonly found atomic nucleus but a different number of neutrons. For example, the hydrogen nucleus has a single proton; deuterium has one proton and one neutron and would be called an isotope of hydrogen. (see neutron; proton.), Two nuclei with the same number of protons but different numbers of neutrons are said to represent the same element, but different isotopes. For example, helium-3, with two protons and one neutron in each nucleus, and helium-4, with two protons and two neutrons, are two different isotopes of helium. . . nuclide (2 facts) - A species of atomic nucleus, analogous to the word ""isotope"" for a species of atom. The word is also used to distinguish between atomic nuclei that are in different energy states. . . proton (13 facts) (p) - A subatomic particle with positive electric charge. Every atom has at least one proton in its nucleus; the number of protons determines the element. For example, all atoms with one proton are hydrogen, all atoms with two protons are helium, and so on., One of the constituents of the atomic nucleus. It is a spin-1/2 particle carrying positive electric charge. The proton is the lightest baryon and, as a result, is the particle into which all other baryons eventually decay. It is believed to be absolutely stable, but certain theories (GUTs) predict it will decay very, very slowly., A baryon made of two up quarks and a down quark. It possesses a positive electromagnetic charge and can only be found in atomic nuclei. A single proton is a hydrogen nucleus., A massive particle with positive electrical charge found in the nuclei of atoms. Composed of two up quarks and one down quark. The proton's mass is 938.3 MeV, slightly less than that of the neutron., A positively charged elementary particle; the nucleus of a hydrogen atom. Mass of proton 1.00728 amu = 1.6726 × 10-24 g = 1836.12 me. . . triton (6 facts) (T) - The nucleus of the tritium atom. . . A neucleus can be found in ALL living cells."	1	4

What is a nucleus?	they do have a nucleus when they are still being formed in the red bone marrow, but once they are mature enough the nucleus is excluded so that there is maximum room to store-hole hemoglobin in the rbc.  less than 1% of rbcs are found in the cirulation-blood.  If more than that,it is indicative of disease and needs to be treated since rbcs with nucleii can't carry oxygen, are too big,and get squished-damaged in the capillaries.  Without a nucleus they can fit single file and go thru without getting too beat up-bruised and live their usual life of 120 days.	0	2
What is a nucleus?	The nucleus, present in eukaryotic cells, is a discrete structure containing chromosomes, the genetic blueprint of the cell. Separated from the cytoplasm of the cell by a double-layered membrane called the nuclear envelope, the nucleus contains a cellular material called nucleoplasm. Nuclear pores, around the circumference of the nuclear membrane, allow the exchange of cellular materials between the nucleoplasm and the cytoplasm.	1	4
What is a nucleus?	1 but it prefers two, as do all atoms prefer to mimic the noble gases.  For instance, if a hydrogen is in a bond it actually has two electons that orbit its nucleus.	0	2
What is a nucleus?	"A nucleus is like the ""brain"" of the cell, it controls everything that goes on in that cell,  it also contains DNA or RNA depending what type of cell it is"	1	4
What is a nucleus?	The nucleus has two main functions: to control chemical reactions with the cytoplasm (day to day operations), and to store the cell's genetic material.	1	3
What is a nucleus?	You could say the nucleus is everything to a cell.. . -It controls cell division-a cell without a nucleus cannot reproduce because the nucleus contains chromosomes which hold all the 'information' about a cell.. -It basically controls all the metabolic activities of the cell, like the type of enzymes to be produced, protein synthesis etc.. -In doing this, the nucleus determines what a particular cell will be like e.g. a guard cell; root hair cell. Without a nucleus, I guess all plant cells would be identical because they wouldn't know what each of their function is.	1	4
why do my baked potatos never taste near as good as when I get them in a nice restaurant?	i think the key might be in the slow cooking...... as far as the skin is concerned, i like to rub the potato in olive oil and cover with seasonings (anything you like, or just seasoned salt is okay) and then poke all over with a fork or icepick and wrap in tin foil.  i cook on 350 for a long time....checking every once in a while....but it does take 45-60 minutes.	1	4
why do my baked potatos never taste near as good as when I get them in a nice restaurant?	Due to the cooking time a lot of restaurants bake potatos twice. Wrap them in foil, with some course sea salt for the first bake. Allow them to cool, unwrap them and bake again.	1	4

why do my baked potatos never taste near as good as when I get them in a nice restaurant?	A lot of restaurants season the outside of the potatoes before they bake them.  This can make quite a difference in the taste.  Also, make sure you are using full fat sour cream, not low fat.  Oddly, I think most restaurants actually use margarine on their potatos instead of butter, which to me tastes more salty than butter.  Try adding a little salt to your potato, too.	1	4

how does Ultraviolet Light Affects Seed Germination and plant growth?	chloroplast contains pigments for capturing solar energy for photosynthesis.plant cells absorb light of visible spectrum that have wavelength between 400 to 700 nm. and uv radiation doesnt fall between it so plant cannot absorb this part of ligt rays. if a plant will be subjected only to uv rays then the plant will die.	1	4
how does Ultraviolet Light Affects Seed Germination and plant growth?	"The purpose of laboratory testing of seed germination is to assess seed quality or viability and to predict performance of the seed and seedling in the field. Seed processed for sale must be tested by a qualified laboratory under the Association of Official Seed Analysts Rules for testing seeds. Several different kinds of testing are available depending on the type of seed to be tested, the conditions of the test, and the potential uses of the seed. The most common tests are the warm germination test, cold germination test, accelerated aging test, and the tetrazolium test. Each test is designed to evaluate various qualities of the seed. Factors that can affect the performance of seed in germination tests include; diseased seed, old seed, mechanically damaged seed, seed stored under high moisture, and excessive heating of seed during storage or drying. In most cases a seed treatment will improve germination of seed only if the poor quality is due to seed-borne disease. . . The most common test is a warm germination test because it is required by seed laws to appear on the label. The percentage of germinating seed in a warm germination test must be printed on the label of the seed if it is to be sold as seed. Germination is defined as: ""the emergence and development from the seed embryo of those essential structures which are indicative of the ability to produce a normal plant under favorable conditions."" The warm germination test reflects the stand producing potential of a seed lot under ideal planting conditions. Usually 400 seed from each seed lot are placed under moist conditions on blotters, rolled towels, or sand and maintained at 77 degrees F for about seven days. At the end of this period the seedlings are categorized as normal, abnormal, or diseased, and dead or hard seeds. The percentage germination is calculated from the number of normal seedlings from the total number of seeds evaluated. . . The cold germination test is designed to measure the ability of seeds to germinate under high soil-moisture content and low soil temperature. This vigor test simulates early season adverse field conditions and usually represents the lowest germination that would be expected from a seed lot planted under such conditions. Actual field germination would normally fall between the cold test result and that of the warm germination test. Seeds are planted in a sand-soil mix at high moisture content and maintained at 50 degrees F for seven days. The test is then placed at 77 degrees F for four days. The percentage of healthy seedlings that emerge at least one inch above the soil is reported. . . The accelerated aging test estimates the carryover potential of a seed lot in warehouse storage. The seeds are exposed to high temperatures and high relative humidity for short periods of time that cause seed deterioration. Seed are suspended over water in a chamber for 72 hours (wheat and soybeans) or 96 hours (corn) then tested in a standard warm germination test. This test only would be used on seed whose longevity was in question. . . The tetrazolium test is a ""quick test"" for seed lot viability. It is useful when an approximate germination percentage is needed immediately. Seeds are soaked overnight in water then treated with tetrazolium to give an indication of viable, abnormal, and dead seeds in the seed lot. This test will not detect seed-borne disease, thus is limited in its ability to estimate seed quality. This test is highly reliable for determining viable seed of corn, wheat, oats, barley, and other grasses. . . If growers wish to use bin-run seed and has not had a germination test conducted by a competent laboratory, they can get an approximate germination test using the following procedure in their own home. . . Place two paper towels in the bottom of a dish or tray, one on top of the other; wet the towels thoroughly and tilt the tray up on one end so that excess water runs off the tray.

how does Ultraviolet Light Affects Seed Germination and plant growth?	Abscisic acid is a hormone that acts to prevent germination of seeds.  Within a ripening fruit the dominant hormone is a gas called ethylene.  Once the seed is outside the fruit the levels of abscisic acid (ABA) determine germination time.  In mature plants ABA is involved in the plant's response to water stresses such as drought, where it acts to limit water loss from leaves by promoting closure of wholes called stomata.	0	2
how does Ultraviolet Light Affects Seed Germination and plant growth?	Germination is the process in botany where growth emerges from a resting stage. The most common example of germination is the sprouting of a seedling from a seed of a flowering plant or gymnosperm. However, the growth of a hypha from a fungal spore is also germination. In a more general sense, germination can imply anything expanding into greater being from a small existence or germ.	1	4
how does Ultraviolet Light Affects Seed Germination and plant growth?	Germination is process of growth in plants from seeds. For e.g. the sprouts(alfalfa sprouts and others) available in the grocery store are because of the process of germination.	0	2
how does Ultraviolet Light Affects Seed Germination and plant growth?	Ultraviolet can cause what they call safe mutation if seeds exposed while germination is going on. other light such as infrared is a must for some seed germination e.g. lettuce.	1	4
how does Ultraviolet Light Affects Seed Germination and plant growth?	Wrong, infrared affects germination, all wavelengths are used for growth	1	3
how does Ultraviolet Light Affects Seed Germination and plant growth?	-UV light irradiation initially increases the rate of seed germination but the subsequent growth of the seedlings was markedly retarded.. -UV light inhibited radicle elongation and shoot elongation  but shoot elongation inhibited to a lesser extent than radicle elongation.. -UV light also suppresses root and shoot biomass, leaf area, and leaf number .	1	3
how does Ultraviolet Light Affects Seed Germination and plant growth?	Lower H2O2 concetration promotes seed germination.30% hydrogen peroxide also is effective as a stimulant of germination. Very dilute hydrogen peroxide also accelerates later growth if used only occasionally.	1	3

how does Ultraviolet Light Affects Seed Germination and plant growth?	Hi,. Germination is the growth process of a mature seed, characterized by the emergence of a stem and root.. . And, by analogy, the beginning or emergence of anything.	0	2
how does Ultraviolet Light Affects Seed Germination and plant growth?	Different plant tissues DIFFERENTIATE in the plant embryo, and each differentiated cell-tissue type is sensitive to different environmental factors at the site of seed's germination, thus different tissues will be able to grow in different directions, above soil or below.  . . When a seed germinates, the embryo sprouts a pre-root structure called the HYPOCOTYL that goes downwards, away from the air-dirt interface, so it goes deeper, away from sun and warmth and with gravity, down into the soil more deeply to help form earliest rooting structure.  A pre-leaf structure called the EPICOTYL also grows from embryo, but it grows UPWARDS towards the warmth and the light of the sun.  It might have to push thru some soil before it breaks ground, though.	1	3
how does Ultraviolet Light Affects Seed Germination and plant growth?	Variant amount of light causes a plant to go from a dormant state to a lively state as far as growth is concerned, even death if there's no light for long amounts of time.	1	4
how does Ultraviolet Light Affects Seed Germination and plant growth?	plants can absorb only certain frequencies of light for photosynthesis. if sunlight is changed, photosynthesis can not take place properly and the growth of the plant is affected.	1	3
how does Ultraviolet Light Affects Seed Germination and plant growth?	I'm always amazed at some of the silly answers I see on here.  I wonder if people are that dumb or trying to be funny.  OK well I majored in Biology and took lots of botany classes.  Seeds germinate and grow towards a light source.  That's why you see them curve and turn if you leave them in a window where they have to move to get to the light source.  They are also able to detect gravity and they use that detection method to direct the roots in the proper direction.. . We did an experiment in college where we put seeds on a rotating disk to throw of their gravity detection.  The seeds roots were not able to orientate themselves.. . Keep in mind that nothing in science is 100%, we only have theories.  Since nobody can ask a plant how or why they do something we can only go by our results from experiments. Thus far our experiments show that seeds are able to detect gravity and sunlight to ensure proper orientation.	0	2
how does Ultraviolet Light Affects Seed Germination and plant growth?	"A germinating seed can be turned upside down several times and the root will still start to bend downwards. This behaviour is an example for a tropism, a movement triggered by a stimulus.. . ""It is not the soil’s humidity that causes the direction of the root, since the root will grow downwards and the shoot will grow upwards even if the plant is placed in an earth-filled tube where the upper part is moist and the lower is dry. If the plant is put into a water-filled tube the lower part of which is exposed to light while the upper is darkened, the direction of growth will still not change: a proof that it is independent of light."" (A. de CANDOLLE, 1834/38). . Rather in 1806 showed the British physiologist A. KNIGHT in a decisive experiment that the direction of root growth is controlled by gravity. Shoot growth thus is mostly negatively geotropic since shoots grow upwards even in complete darkness."	1	4
how does Ultraviolet Light Affects Seed Germination and plant growth?	Seed absorbs water . water dissolves the stored food in the seed supplies food to embryo or baby plant. IN  the presence of sunlight the root tip and stem tip release hormones which in turn make the growth of root and stem.this process is called 'differentiation'. when once the seed developed in to seed ling with one or two leaflets they start synthesising the food with the help of sunlight and it grows,	1	4
how does Ultraviolet Light Affects Seed Germination and plant growth?	The Da Vinci code may be fiction, but the concept of the Catholic Church being deceptive (that's the nicest way I will say it) is a proven fact.. . The problem that the church sees is that many Catholics, especially in light of all the REAL conspiracies that have been uncovered in the last decade or so, are going to get the seed planted in their minds, that maybe their church isn't perfect.. . And once that seed is planted, a cursory examination of the church's history will make non-believers out of every last one of them.	0	1
how does Ultraviolet Light Affects Seed Germination and plant growth?	Changes in catalase (CAT) activity and in CAT isoform pattern and expression were investigated in developing sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.) seeds during desiccation on the mother plant and after artificial drying on the flowerheads. Seeds regularly desiccated during their development on the mother plant and reached mass maturity at c. 42 d after flowering (DAF). Freshly harvested seeds did not germinate at any stage of development because they were dormant, but their dormancy was broken after 5–6 months of dry storage. Immature seeds were desiccation-tolerant at 24 DAF since they were able to germinate fully after artificial drying on the flowerheads followed by dry storage. CAT activity increased in non-dehydrated seeds during their development, reaching a maximum a little after seed mass maturity and after artificial drying in immature seeds. This stimulation of CAT activity by natural and artificial drying was related to changes in CAT isoform pattern. Of the four constitutive CAT subunits, that of 59 kDa was always present, but dehydration induced the synthesis of a 55 kDa subunit. This synthesis of the CAT 55 kDa subunit resulted from an activation of the CATA1 gene, suggesting that the regulation of catalase activity and synthesis by drying occurred at the transcriptional level. The increase in CAT activity induced by seed drying was associated with a decrease in hydrogen peroxide level and in lipid peroxidation. These results suggest that CAT plays a role during seed desiccation by preventing dehydration-related oxidative damage and that H2O2 may play a role in the regulation of CAT gene expression and the transduction pathway of the dehydration signal.	0	2
how does Ultraviolet Light Affects Seed Germination and plant growth?	The shoot from the germinating seed travels in the direction where it encounters the least resistance.. . Going deeper underground or to the sides, it finds the soil too tightly packed. Ditto to the sides. But upward - the direction from which it was planted - the soil is looser.. . Try this experiment:  get a seed and plant it in some earth, up against the side of a transparent container.  Use a good-sized amount - enough to *pack* the soil, very deep and very hard, overtop the seed.. . Basically, you want to encase that poor seed in what amounts to a brick of soil. Keep the exposed side - the side where the seed is against the glass - away from the light. Best to just drap a towel over the container whenever you're not directly observing it.. . Then wait. The seed will probably sprout, but it'll take a long time to breach the surface - if it ever manages.	0	2
how does Ultraviolet Light Affects Seed Germination and plant growth?	Apple seeds will not germinate unless they are held at cold temperatures for quite awhile - you can refrigerate them for a couple of days.. . This is not true for all seeds. They all have different germination requirements - like, eucalyptus seeds require extreme heat like a forest fire to germinate.	0	2
what cause the car to have white smoke coming from the muffler and making a kicking or knocking sounds?	You have a blown head gasket and possibly a cracked head.  Since it is a 93, I would suggest replacing the car.  You can get a different car for what it will cost to fix this old beast.	1	4
what cause the car to have white smoke coming from the muffler and making a kicking or knocking sounds?	Out of round bore, cracked, worn, or scored liner will cause piston rings to wear faster; increasing oil consumption, causing blue smoke in exhaust. If crack goes thru to water jacket, will cause some loss of coolant, white smoke (steam) in exhaust.	1	4
what cause the car to have white smoke coming from the muffler and making a kicking or knocking sounds?	The leaded fuel contains Tetraethyle lead (TEL) in small quantities. The reason for using this is that the piston type engines, while running on the Gasolin, sometimes produce a knocking sound which is due to the premature ignition of fuel/air mixture - knocking the piston down while it was going up during a compression cycle. This causes severe damage to the engine parts and, also, the unearthly knocking sound.. . Lead, while emitted through the exhaust pipes, enters the environment and causes sever damage.. . Its use was thus banned and other anti-knocking materials were discovered.	1	3

I noticed it does not overheat or anything like that. The outside temperature is 38 deg F. All the other cars are running fine. Sometimes I smell coolant inside the car but have been unable to find a wet spot in the car. Help.. . Answer: White smoke when first started is normal. If white smoke continues you have an internal coolant leak, i.e., cracked head/blown head gasket. Black smoke is caused by a rich fuel condition. Blue smoke is caused by oil consumption. The smell of coolant inside your car is caused by a leaking heater core."""	1	3

what cause the car to have white smoke coming from the muffler and making a kicking or knocking sounds?	Tinitus is caused by the blood vessles in your ear causing the ear sensory cillia to vibrate which in turn makes you think you are hearing a sound coming from the outside.  Most tinitus sufferers simply put on a masking sound - sometimes called white noise - that helps blot out the sound coming from inside their ears.  There is supposed to be a device that will transmit a sound that has the opposite wave characteristics from the one generated by the tinitus which will cause the person to not hear any sound - that is neither the tinitus sound nor a masking sound - as the sound transmitted by the device will cancel out the tinitus sound.  This is a better option but I don't think it has been technologically proven yet.	0	1

It's the same white smoke that comes out of your tailpipe when you turn on your car on a really cold day. A plane just produces who whole lot more of it. It happens depending on the temperature and other weather conditions.	1	4
what cause the car to have white smoke coming from the muffler and making a kicking or knocking sounds?	because when you're car is moving or the engine is running, air is forced over the engine, blowing the smoke away. when you're still, it collects and you can see it coming from under the hood.	1	4
what cause the car to have white smoke coming from the muffler and making a kicking or knocking sounds?	Not enough info here but may be your vehicle is running way to reach. Is there black smoke coming out the tail pipe?	1	3
what cause the car to have white smoke coming from the muffler and making a kicking or knocking sounds?	"Valve cover gaskets were a common source of oil leaks onto the exhaust manifolds of older American cars and would produce the smoke you describe. If you truly have a ""carburetor"", it sounds like that's your problem."	1	4
what cause the car to have white smoke coming from the muffler and making a kicking or knocking sounds?	The milky looking oil/sludge (looks kinda like dirty vaseline) is the best indicator, however you'll also have a white smoke coming out of your tail pipe that smells like anti-freeze.  Also you'll probably be getting crap gas mileage.	0	2
what cause the car to have white smoke coming from the muffler and making a kicking or knocking sounds?	whats up man i have a 2000 civic si and the best way to make it not sound like a pissed off bumble bee on speed is to change out the muffler with an aftermarket muffler which you can get and have put on for a couple hundred dollars or you can go with a complete cat back exhaust which will last alot longer and sound much better but that route cost alot more money so it really depends on your own preference. if your going for performance and sound i would go with the full exhaust thats what i did and it made a big difference. i hope i was some help good luck and dont listen to all that trade it in or buy a ford mess.  in my opinion you have a better car and to me imports are the only way to go.	1	3
what cause the car to have white smoke coming from the muffler and making a kicking or knocking sounds?	Some white smoke coming out the tail pipe is normal. It is actually steam that is coming out and the reason it does that is because the catalytic converter is actually doing its job in oxidizing the poisonous gases that come out. So its turning hydro carbons into water and carbon monoxide into carbon dioxide. Hope I answered your question but if you want to play it safe take to your local repair shop for an inspection.	1	4
what cause the car to have white smoke coming from the muffler and making a kicking or knocking sounds?	it means that you will have your exhaust up graded form your catalytic converter back which is better parts and muffler on your car!!!	1	3
what cause the car to have white smoke coming from the muffler and making a kicking or knocking sounds?	Typically when a car only heats up at an idle or in traffic, that's usually caused by the electric cooling fan not working. The water could be lost when it heats up in traffic. If a headgasket is suspected, take off the radiator cap when the engine is cool and start the car and watch for bubbles. Typically if a head gasket is blown you have lots of white smoke from the exhaust also.	1	4
what cause the car to have white smoke coming from the muffler and making a kicking or knocking sounds?	Check your heads, rocker arms, and all your seals in the upper part of your engine, sound like something is off track or knocked loose and is causing uncombusted gas to fly out of the chamber and through you air intake valves. Also make sure your timing is correct, if not it could be causeing the piston to rise and or fall destroy the proper vacuum effect and will then cause gas to pump out your air intake vavles and pump it all they way back out to your carbeurator. If this is the cause, you should also have noticed a decrease in performance, anywhere from slight to emmense, and th car will hesitate quite often, especailly if the timing is off, because it is unable to burn the gas properly, and can even flood the chambers, and cause your car to die while driving! Get it fixed immediatly	1	4
what cause the car to have white smoke coming from the muffler and making a kicking or knocking sounds?	the smoke is on everything... even in sponge that the seats are made of. Ur best bet is to not let smoke in Ur car and cover it up until it clears. oh and don't forget the headliner. it collects the smoke and keeps it locked in its own material this was the problem in my car, hopefully u wont have to replace it	0	1
what cause the car to have white smoke coming from the muffler and making a kicking or knocking sounds?	white smoke without the smell of gasoline indicates head gasket leak and engine coolant is escaping thru cylinders and out of your exaust, but with the smell of gasoline it indicates unburnt fuel, sounds like your choke is stuck or your carb might need to be rebuilt cause its dumping way too much fuel into the engine.  im guessing your mpg has been crappy after the smoke has appeared also.	1	4

Nowadays, it's all about the few hundred executives in control of the world economy, trying to shove their shitty products through our throats at all times.

how were the witches tested in the salem witch trials?	There wasn't really a method. They looked to see if you had any marks that would be the devils...but most of them were simply accused by the ranting girls or by neighbors who were in debt to the accused or something like that. And, since the court was too stubborn to back down, they simply kept sentencing people...until the girls went too far and accused a high officals daughter.	1	4
how were the witches tested in the salem witch trials?	A witch-hunt was traditionally a search for witches or evidence of witchcraft, which could lead to a witchcraft trial involving the accused person.	1	3
how were the witches tested in the salem witch trials?	The events which led to the Witch Trials actually occurred in what is now the town of Danvers, then a parish of Salem Town, known as Salem Village.

The Witch House  In February, 1692, three accused women were examined by Magistrates Jonathan Corwin and John Hathorne. Corwin's home, known as the Witch House, still stands at the corner of North and Essex Streets in Salem, providing guided tours and tales of the first witchcraft trials. John Hathorne, an ancestor of author Nathaniel Hawthorne, is buried in the Charter Street Old Burying Point.   .    By the time the hysteria had spent itself, 24 people had died. Nineteen were hanged on Gallows Hill in Salem Town, but some died in prison. Giles Corey at first pleaded not guilty to charges of witchcraft, but subsequently refused to stand trial. This refusal meant he could not be convicted legally. However, his examiners chose to subject him to interrogation by the placing of stone weights on his body. He survived this brutal torture for two days before dying. . It is remarkable 552 original documents pertaining to the witchcraft trials have been preserved and are still stored by the Peabody Essex Museum. . . Eerie memorabilia associated with the trials, such as the ""Witch Pins"" used in the examination of witches and a small bottle supposed to contain the finger bones of the victim George Jacobs can be found there as well. .     .   *These short paragraphs are intended only as an introduction to a complex subject about which much has been written.  .

From June through September of 1692, nineteen men and women, all having been convicted of witchcraft, were carted to Gallows Hill, a barren slope near Salem Village, for hanging. Another man of over eighty years was pressed to death under heavy stones for refusing to submit to a trial on witchcraft charges. Hundreds of others faced accusations of witchcraft. Dozens languished in jail for months without trials.  Then, almost as soon as it had begun, the hysteria that swept through Puritan Massachusetts ended. .     Why did this travesty of justice occur? Why did it occur in Salem? Nothing about this tragedy was inevitable.

how were the witches tested in the salem witch trials?	Besides the methods mentioned above, an accused witch was literally bought to trial before the court.

how were the witches tested in the salem witch trials?	"On of the ways was to throw the suspected witch in a lake or large vat of water.  If she floated, see was a witch.

how were the witches tested in the salem witch trials?	"Because Traditionally, Witches are portrayed as villians in folk lore and fairytales.  Take any three ""Old World"" fairytales and you will see what i mean.  This even goes back to the early days of film and particularly animation.  In many of the early Disney movies (based on fairytales) witches are the villians.  This includes ""Sleeping Beauty"", ""Snow White"" and even later movies like ""Little Mermaid"".. . But this stigma (In film) probally goes back to the 1600s and the witch scares in America and England (If you think the Salem Witch Trials were bad you shouls look into what was happening in England).  This was a time that little was known about Wiccan beliefs, and the Holier then thou mindframe of the time.  It was believed at the time (and some believe now) that witches were in leauge with the devil.. . And people seem to forget that ""The Wizard of Oz"" features the most beloved witch of all time... Galinda.  (I might have spelled it wrong)"	0	2
how were the witches tested in the salem witch trials?	"The Puritans were originally members of a group of English Protestants seeking ""purity"" — further reforms or even separation from the established church — during the Protestant Reformation. There are to this day people who call themselves Puritans, but much of their original teaching (for instance, their line of reasoning that led to the Salem witch trials) has been left behind."	0	2
how were the witches tested in the salem witch trials?	"If you are thinking that they had gnarled faces with warts........YOU ARE SO WRONG.  They looked, and still look, the same as you and I.  Period dress may have changed, but faith is the same.  The witches of the 1600s they look, dressed, acted the same.  Although, few of them did live away from the rest of the town.  But if you are wanting to know what people wore in that era...I suggest you watch ""The Crucible""...this is a movie..as well as a book...based on the accusations of the Salem Witch Trials."	0	2
how were the witches tested in the salem witch trials?	"If you read Arthur Miller's fabulous play ""The Crucible"" you will find many of these answers. It was written about the Salem witch trials and written during the McCarthy era.  Perhaps this is why you ask the question.  Trust me, the answers are there if you look hard enough."	1	3
how were the witches tested in the salem witch trials?	The main similarity is in the so-called investigation techniques.  In both instances, once someone was accused they were interrogated until they revealed the names of others who were cohorts or suspect.  In both instances, once you revealed some names - genuine or not - you were free to go, but refusing to play ball got you incarcerated.. . Obviously, the witch trials were a little more violent in nature - while there were some isolated instances of torture and execution under McCarthyism, in comparison nearly every interrogation in the witch trials included it.	0	2
how were the witches tested in the salem witch trials?	Arthur Miller wrote The Crucible in the 1950's when Senator Joseph McCarthy was in the process of accusing people of being Communist.  Miller made a conscious effort to link McCarthyism and the Salem Witch trials in The Crucible to show the similarities of the effects that these two periods in history had and to show people the mistakes of the past in hopes that they will not make them again in the future.	0	2

what is the punishment for child molestors?	because the founder is a lying child molester and murderer	0	2
what is the punishment for child molestors?	I have to disagree with viking no3.. . The problem is not the child molestation.. . The problem is that the hierarchy knew about the child molestation for at least 30 years and did nothing to protect parishioners, but instead protected the molestors.  The true evil is not that a few priests are perverts, but that the whole institution of Catholic clerics protected their own rather than doing the right thing.	0	2
what is the punishment for child molestors?	Yes, there are problems with Priests molesting young boys, but you know what?  There are more teachers molesting children than there are priests.  There are more police officers that molest children than there are priests, in fact, if you were to look at society as a whole, the percentage of RC Priests that molest children is less than 5%.. . Is 5% to high a number?  Yes, it is.  But one person that molests a child by ANY member of society is one to many.. . I do not condone what some of these priests have done, but I have to agree with what a previous poster has said.  The RCC is considered to be very wealthy, and some of these people who are claiming to be molested 30 and 40 years ago are after the money.. . Some are legit, I have no doubt, but for those that wait for so long, what is the reason?  In some cases the priest has died or retired, has moved around so much that it is impossible to decide what is truth.  Result?  Easy money AND it has the added benefit of making the Church look bad.. . Again, I do not condone what this small number of priests are doing, but I can not agree with your statement that the church actively recruits these people.. . Also, for those who say it is because they can not marry, I would like to bring to your attention that the vast majority of child molestors are married with children of their own.	0	2
what is the punishment for child molestors?	In the state of Indiana, it doesn't matter who molests a child, that person is getting charged.  The fact that the perpetrator was in a position of responsibility over the child, that would be an aggravating circumstance meaning that once the conviction is reached, the judge would have to consider imposing a harsher sentence.	1	3
what is the punishment for child molestors?	They shouldn't, most of those scumbags should be killed rather than get to live another day.  The death penalty should be in every state for rapists, and murderers, and child molesters should be killed slow.	0	2
what is the punishment for child molestors?	It is NOT legal, in any way, for someone to molest a child under 6 (or over 6, for that matter...). . Now, whether the punishment fits the crime is another matter, in my opinion.. . However, regardless of the child's age, the charges aren't pressed by the parents, they are pressed by the State, and the parents don't have any say in the matter (except for when it's one parent or the other that comes forward saying their child has been molested, but even then it's up to the State to press charges, that's just more a matter of how cooperative the parents are going to be about it.). . Any legal actions the parents might pursue would be a civil suit.. . Also, in most cases, the court will appoint a lawyer to represent the child's interests, seperate from the parents, even if the parent(s) are not the offender.  (Again, how well they preform their jobs can be an issue...). . So, it's not a matter of it being legal or not, and who will pursue it, but it's more a matter of whether or not the legal system will adequately punish the offender, but all too often, they get away with just a slap on the wrist, because, after all, children don't vote or pay taxes, so they aren't as important to elected officials as they should be.	1	3

Well, eight days later the disciples are again meeting indoors. This time Thomas is with them.

Freedom of Speech - why don't people understand how to use it?	The idea behind freedom of speech is that you can say anything you want as long as it doesn't cause the harm of others. You can't yell fire in a crowded movie theater, but you can speak out against you government or any other group. The problem is that people don't limit their actions to speech. Furthermore, our country is a lot better then pretty much any other and all you people who want to complain so much, just leave and you'll find out what it's like to be oppressed.	1	4

How do I grow taller?	"hey, i'm taller than both my parents and almost taller than my 19 yr old brother (i'm 14). my parents used to make me drink milk, well, they just tell me to all the time. i'm 5' 5 1/2"", and i get hit in the head a lot, by soccerballs, tennis rackets, and in caves. some people said i shouldn't be that tall because i'm asian or that i'm a girl, but that has almost nothing to do with it. see how tall your parents or grandparents are and ask about their living conditions back then. my parents had to work to live, and they were hungry almost every night and said that they lived in a very poor time period in their country. i have a girl in my orchestra class that is 4' 11"". i thought she was a sophomore or a freshman, but she was actually a senior and she just turned 18! it makes her seem a lot shorter because she playes that gigantic double bass. i havent grown that much since 7th grade, when my growth spurt stopped. for girls, it is usually between when you are 9 and 12 years old, when i grew a couple inches in a year, but now i've only grown a few millimeters since 2 years ago, and i'm almost certain that i'll stop growing soon because my mom stopped growing when she was 14. but then, there are people who complain about being tall or being short, i'd like to stay average. besides, there are always high-heeled shoes and you could straighten your back and look confident, so it doesnt matter how tall you are. ♪♥♫"	1	4

How do I grow taller?	Bones and cells definitely plays a big role in determining the height of individuals but I don't think they provide a clear answer as to why guys are usually taller than gals.. Here is my opinion...They way I see it, men and women are just equal in the height department. That means women can grow as tall as any men can. It only seem like there are more women who are shorter than men because you commonly see them walking around in pairs, and as you know very well, our society dictates that it's ideal to have a taller guy in a relationship than a taller girl. . But Try to check out tha physical stature of guys and girls from an asian country for a change. And compare the height of the asian males to those of caucasian females.You'll see that there are more taller caucasian females than asian males! Proving that it is not really true that guys are actually taller than women.It depends on a lot of factors really, ANd sometimes you just gotta look at it from a different perspective in order to see what is not obvious.	0	2

They usually give good suggestions of: sleeping at least 8-9 hrs a night, eating a lot of food (including intaking a lot of calcium), and exercising. That said, most people (including myself) stop growing around 17. If you are still growing however, these are things you can do.. .

She can have it removed by a doctor, use a wart remover (Freeze Off), try keeping a banana on it until it comes off, or keep a penny on it until it comes off (like you would with the banana).

I suggest trying the banana first.  Just cut a slice of banana and place it on the wart.  Then secure it with something sticky (a band-aid or tape).  Keep replacing the banana with a fresh slice until it goes away.  My sister tried it and it worked (on two different warts) and they never came back.  The band-aid might look crazy on her face but if the wart goes away you will accomplish your goal.	1	4

"How to ""LOSE""all body fat ?"	If the belly fat you are talking about is actually loose skin left over from losing weight or pregnancy, the only way to lose it is through surgery.

"How to ""LOSE""all body fat ?"	The key to getting a six pack is losing the body fat. You cannot simply spot-lose--as in, losing fat JUST on your stomach. Fat loss comes with overall body loss--so if you are chubby to begin with, you lose arm fat and lower leg fat before you lose fat on your waist, hips, and thighs. If you are skinnier to begin with, you lose fat on your torso--stomach, waist--since the other fat is already gone. The key to getting a six pack, thus, is to do lots of cardio (given you already have plenty of muscle.) Stripping the fat away, you will reveal your abs. Also--eating right is just as important, if not important, than simply hitting the gym. Building a killer body is about 30% gym and 70% nutrition.	1	4

How does your body burn the fat? . . If you started exercising and then reached a plateau, you have probably burned more muscle tissue than fat with your workout. This is the worst thing that could happen.. . Let me explain. . . Less Muscle = slower metabolism = Weight loss plateau. Then you end up in the yo-yo dieting bandwagon.. . How to burn the *fat* instead of burning muscles.. . You need to do some MODERATE cardio training. The key word here is moderate. . Doing too much cardio can be detrimental and I am sure you have seen those people that are doing cardio on a daily basis and still not getting anywhere. The result is a low metabolism.

"How to ""LOSE""all body fat ?"	Yes, I have found that by purchasing both body fat percentage scales (Tanita) and body fat callipers (Accu-Measure), you can get an accurate idea of your body fat percentage by cross-referencing the two readings. Using body fat callipers does take a little practice, but if you find the two readings are similar or the same, then you can be pretty sure that it is a fairly accurate measurement of your body fat percentage.

You must exercise. this increases the metabolic rate, (the rate your body turns stored fat into energy). then you will be burning the stored fat that makes up your weight.. . You must burn more calories each day than you eat/drink to lose weight.. . this is how it works.    . . GOOD LUCK WITH IT, AND DON'T EXPECT MIRACLES OVERNIGHT.	1	3
"How to ""LOSE""all body fat ?"	Have you ever seen body builders in their off-season....all big bulky back and arms, huge ripped legs and a fat gut....this is because the body tends to store fat in the abdominal region first and it does so relatively easy too.. I am assuming that you are a slim person with some belly fat then it should be easier for  you to lose your fat with proper diet and cardio vascular exercise (burning more calories than you take in).. Crunches, leg lifts, sit ups etc will not get rid of the fat but will tone and strengthen the underlying muscles while you burn the fat off with cardio.. . Forget that digestion claim about the belly fat.. . Exercise and proper diet incorporated into your lifestyle will get rid of that belly fat and keep it off!!!	0	2

how does disneyland make it snow?	Of course not.  Most people do not know this, but Walt Disney actually created Disneyland for adults!  He wanted a place where both children and adults could learn and have fun together.  Disney believed in being a child at heart.  Children search, discover, and are not embarrased to admit they have learned.  Disneyland was created as place of education, hope, and love to all people.  Embracing the child within is healthy and is something that should be explored by every individual, everyday.  I'm not naive enough to think that elements in Walt Disney's original plan for Disneyland have not been changed for business purposes, and there is the slowly spreading belief that Disney is for children, when Walt Disney firmly believed that any business geared directly toward children would not be successful.  So, no Disneyland is for everyone.  It's for discovering that sometimes fantasy is more real than reality.  . . One time a man was at Disneyland and sat on a bench next to another, older man who, at the time, was difficult to recognize.  The younger man mentioned how Disneyland kept you from reality, and the older man promptely answered that this park was reality, and it was everything outside of it, that was fantasy.  That older man was Walt Disney.. . So go enjoy Disneyland.  Learn the beautiful history behind It's a Small World, so you may enjoy it.  Understand it's appearance at the World's Fair.  Know what a step that World's Fair was in technology and the understanding of other cultures.  Learn and explore.  It's a small world after all, with a lot to learn in it.  And sing...  sing it's a small world.	0	2

what exemplifies effective customer service?	A customer is a human being, who customarily purchases a particular product, or service.. A consumer is merely a person, animal, or even machine that consumes any particular product, or service - without necessarily evincing a liking for it, or purchasing it.. For example, if you buy a tub of ice cream you are a customer. If you give it to child, who polishes it off, the child is a consumer. Similarly, a customer will buy a bundle of straw for a cow to consume. And an automobile will consume any brand of petrol purchased by its owner, who is the real customer.... Thus a customer turns into a consumer, only when he/she consumes the purchase. And a consumer turns customer, when he/she chooses a particular product or service, and buys it ! . ...But the sad part is that even persons who are actively involved in marketing and advertising confuse themselves [and others too !] by misusing both of these terms !	1	4

Housekeepers are occasionally portrayed in literature as being the most senior staff member and as even making recommendations for the hiring of the butler.. . In modern houses where the butler is the most senior worker, titles such as Majordomo, Butler Administrator, Staff Manager, Estate Manager and Head of Household Staff are sometimes given.. . The word ""butler"" derives from the Old French ""bouteillier"", (meaning ""cup bearer""), from ""bouteille"", (""bottle""). The role of the butler, for centuries, has been that of the chief steward of a household, the attendant entrusted with the care and serving of wine and other bottled beverages (which in ancient times represented a considerable portion of the household's assets.). . In Britain the butler was originally a middle ranking member of the staff of a grand household. In the 17th and 18th centuries the butler gradually became the usually senior male member of a household's staff (in the very grandest households there was sometimes a house steward senior to the butler into the 19th century). Butlers used to always be attired in a special uniform, distinct from the livery of junior servants, but today a butler is more likely to wear a business suit or business casual clothing and appear in uniform only on special occasions.. . The earliest literary mention of a butler is probably that of the man whose release from prison was predicted by Joseph in the biblical account of Joseph's interpretation of the dreams of the Pharaoh's servants.. . In London there remains only one hotel which offers a private butler service, The Lanesborough Hotel."	1	4

Scopes had to pay $100 fine for contravening the Butler Act forbidding the teaching of evolution in public schools in Tennessee although Darrow wanted the case to go to an appeal. On appeal, the law was found to be constitutional but the conviction was overturned on a technicality. The law was not found to be unconstitutional until 1968 with the Butler Act being repealed in 1967.. . What Darrow did achieve was to turn public opinion amongst educated people against the laws, thus setting the scene for a long-term change of opinion. Bryan is generally believed to have come out of it very badly. The Scopes Trial was widely followed and was the subject of books. A play and film ""Inherit the Wind"" was loosely based on it."	0	1

Find out what the customer expects and that is your definition of good customer service. Incidentally, it makes no sence to deliver on something the customer has no interest in. At McDonalds for example, they experiemented with waiters who actually came to your table and took your order. It didn't work well because when most people go to McDonalds they just want the right food fast.. . GE	0	2

Why do we need to tell customer service/operator about our sickness in order to make appointment w/ a doctor?	It's so they know how much time to schedule for the appointment. If it's a minor illness, they'll schedule you for fewer minutes, and for more complicated cases, they'll schedule more time with the doctor. It's only to lessen the time you spend in the waiting room, not necessarily because they're nosy bastards.	1	4

Why do we need to tell customer service/operator about our sickness in order to make appointment w/ a doctor?	"They might need to know, so they can figure out whether you need to see the doctor ""right away"" or it can wait a few days.. . I don't go into specifics with operators.

Why do we need to tell customer service/operator about our sickness in order to make appointment w/ a doctor?	"The operator takes down your major symptoms and allots an appointment based on their (ahem!) 'training'. Apparently they can schedule a longer appointment if necessary.. . Also, the idea is that a staff nurse or the doctor will look through the list of patients/appointments at some point and do some minor 'triage'. If anything jumps out then they will call the patient and have them either come in immediately or visit the Emergency Room at a local hospital.. . Personally, I believe that I could describe my symptoms as, ""I just sawed my leg off,"" and my appointment would still be three weeks away!. . But yes, it is kind of 'icky'.... . ME: ""Hello... yes... well, my penis is twice it's normal size and it's grown two ears and some hair on it's head."". . CS: ""Oh yes, we can fit you in on Tuesday, August 5th 2007. Can you make that time?"""	1	3
Why do we need to tell customer service/operator about our sickness in order to make appointment w/ a doctor?	"Well, they need to be able to make a decision about how serious it is. If you broke your nose, you need to be seen soon. If you have a funky wart on you knee, that can wait. They are only trying to help.. . And you don't have to tell them your life story, you know. You can be vauge. Instead of telling them that you've been, say, on your period for a month, you can say you're having a ""girly"" problem.. . They aren't trying to pry, they are just trying to get you the help you need within a reasonable amount of time."	1	4

Why do we need to tell customer service/operator about our sickness in order to make appointment w/ a doctor?	The customer service people decide which doctor you need to see. Certain doctors only deal with certain issues. Also the doctor can do some research beforehand to find out what kind of illness you have.. . I think that people who know were they need to go should have direct access to a doctor. Those who are stupid need customer service to guide them to the right doctor.	1	4

Just tell the operator their are HEPPA laws that prevent you from discussing any med. reasons from answering these questions.

Why do we need to tell customer service/operator about our sickness in order to make appointment w/ a doctor?	I work in Customer Service for an animal supply company on the west coast. I have a set customer base that I service. It is so much fun to work with the same customers. I get to know them, their stores, their ordering patterns, etc. They begin to trust you and depend on you to help them through issues they have with their stores. Most of the stores we service are small Mom and Pop corner shops, so this is their bread and butter.  I love the person to person contact and the fact that I get to build a relationship with my set customers. I don't think that I would be nearly as fulfilled in a customer service department just answering any old line.... Hope that helped!	0	2

Customer Service, for example, what is it about you personally and professionally can you offer that is different or you feel is important...something that makes you stand out from all others. I recruit for retail stores and I am shocked that people who apply for the positions forget that they are consumers as well. I love when an applicant tells me what they look for in customer service when they are out shopping and how they would use their past experiences (with examples) as a way to make them be better sales associates.	0	1

Why do we need to tell customer service/operator about our sickness in order to make appointment w/ a doctor?	"I work for a retailer that truly takes pride in customer service and training its associates. This is what makes us stand out in comparison to the competition. Our motto is ""Never Say No"". We are compensated well for what we do and thats what makes the difference. If you pay $5.15/hr. thats the level of service you should expect. If you're an associate making $16.00/hr. its a hell of a lot easier to smile and say ""Hi""! Lastly, all employers preach customer service but in order to make the books look good to investors, they cut back on payroll. This causes a lot of stress on that one associate being pulled in 10 different directions. Of course as the day wears on, he's not going to be the most pleasent person to deal with. Anyway, go shop at a Bed, Bath, and Beyond and tell me what you think about the service you get?"	0	1

Muslims Are The Happiest People Ever, Why?	Some of the happiest people I have ever met have never heard of Moses, Jesus or Mohammed (among them a very old  Mayan woman in the Yucatan chanting over her husband's body.)

Muslims Are The Happiest People Ever, Why?	"The only Muslims I have come across are full of ""Hate"" for their fellow man; Loise Farrakhan..called Jews dogs of the earth. We see daily Muslims rioting against Israel and America. They want to kill anyone who doesn't agree with the. Koran and it's teaching, especially about Mohammad. I think there are moderate Muslims that live in peace with their neighbors and cause no harm..but then there is the radical Muslims who hate Jews and Americans. We see this type of radical thinking in most of the worlds religions except for Judaism. I think the best things Muslims can do is to ask for the forgiveness of their murder and crimes against Israel..then the world can begin to forgive them for the evil they have done...Peace!"	0	2

Muslims Are The Happiest People Ever, Why?	I really think the happiest people in the world are those who are......HAPPY.. . Unless you the QURAN now includes a chapter where it claims Muslims MUST be happier than all the others, in which case i'd bend to Allah's will and would accept the view. We all know he's always Right.. In the meantime, could you pass on your question to the following groups of muslims?. . a) Muslims gays in all middle eastern countries, with particular reference to Turkey, Egypt, Syria and Iran?. b) All women in Middle Eastern countries, except Jordan, Lebanon, and a few others. c) Did you know in some African countries muslims adopted the non muslim practice of Infibulation, consisting in the surgical removal of the clitorid of women in order to deprive them from any source of sexual pleasure? The practice is done by an older woman without any specific tool, they just pull and cut.. d) Did you know that in other muslim countries they adopted the practice of sewing the vaginal lips always for the same reason, and that many of those women leave their country and have to undergo painful surgical interventions after that thraumatic experience?. g) did you know muslim immigrants still kill their daughters or sisters when they don't marry the men their parents tell them to marry. (see Germany, Turkey, Paksitan and several other places or simply check AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL). Did you know they burn their women to punish them or that they take them in the squares of their towns and kill them by lapidation with the participation of the whole citizenship?. h) Did you know in Saudi Arabia there is one of the highest rates of paedophilia?. i) Did you know muslims have one of the highest rates of homosexuality?. h) Did you know the highest number of rapists in Europe is made up of Muslims, which is even sadder if you consider their are still a minority in many countries?. If that's called happiness then i wonder what is to you unhappiness.. Good luck mate and God Bless you and your ideas(whoever he is)	1	4
Muslims Are The Happiest People Ever, Why?	Because Allah (SWT) revealed to us how to live a simple life.  If we follow his words, not only will we live a peaceful life but we will go to paradise.

It's the eminent IQ test: happy=moron, sad=smart.. That's a really funny question, though there's nothing really wrong with being optimistic or accepting limitations, I don't think. I'm not that way but I tend to love people who are...	1	4
Muslims Are The Happiest People Ever, Why?	Maybe because of the Africans constantly trying to get over to Italy (which lies quite close to Africa). They have constant problems with the Africans in this regard, and so this could cause some negative feelings to blacks (I don't know about racism to other peoples except maybe Arabs who are Muslim and this would be fore the same reason why so many other people don't like Muslims). Kind of like Americans and the Mexican-illegals. Its the same thing.	0	2

Section 4.34.4 of the ADA Accessibility Guidelines for Buildings and Facilities (Appendix to Part 1191, 36 CFR Chapter XI, issued pursuant to the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990) says, ""Instructions and all information for use [of an automated teller machine] shall be made accessible to and independently usable by persons with vision impairments."". . Drive-up ATMs, unlike the walk-up variety, don't need to be wheelchair accessible, but the rules make no exception regarding accessibility by the blind."	1	4
Why is there brail on the keypads at drive up ATM's?	"because the manufacturers of the keypads only make one style, so it's cheaper that way, instead of making a separate one just for drive-thrus.. . By the way, damn near any question that begins with ""Why...?"", the answer is MONEY."	1	4
Why is there brail on the keypads at drive up ATM's?	Because all of the keypads are made at the same place.  The same keypads that go on a normal ATM are used in the drive-thru ones.  It wouldn't be cost effective to make seperate ones without the braille.	1	4
Why is there brail on the keypads at drive up ATM's?	Why not is the question. If it costs the same to manufacture an ATM with Braille as without, then why not. It doesn't harm the seeing person to have Braille on the keypad. It's more cost effective. Drive up ATM's really aren't drive up. They're just placed so that you can drive up. In reailty most people have to unbuckle lean out and contort themselves to use those ATMs.	1	4
Why is there brail on the keypads at drive up ATM's?	Cute question.  . . Probably for practical reasons...the keypads are mass produced and put on all ATM's regardless of whether they are drive-through.  It's more efficient that way.	1	3
Why is there brail on the keypads at drive up ATM's?	It's cheaper to manufacture one set of keypads that you use on all ATM machines regardless of location, than to create one keypad for drive-thrus, one for walk ups, etc.  And since it does not exist, tt also ensures that the sight-only version is never installed where a blind person would need it.	1	4
Why is there brail on the keypads at drive up ATM's?	I would say for the blind.  Obviously they did not drive by themselves.  Banks provide it because if another person has driven them to the ATM,  the blind may want to use the keypads themselves for security reasons so they would not have to depend on the one who can see with their password and/or banking purposes.	1	4
Why is there brail on the keypads at drive up ATM's?	Its for people who wear glasses for long distance sight, they cant read close up and the brail helps them navigate on the keypad	1	4

Why is there brail on the keypads at drive up ATM's?	I have asked this question before and also heard this question a lot, no one has given me an answer. I think we should ask the people who design the atm machines. I wonder if they just make them all the same, so they just have them on them, because the ones in malls do too..????	1	3
Why is there brail on the keypads at drive up ATM's?	It is probably because the machines are standardized and the same keypads are used for the walk up ATM machines. . . However, I have noticed that the McDonald's drive thru has a sign saying Braille menu is available.	1	4
Why is there brail on the keypads at drive up ATM's?	HAAHA	0	1
Why is there brail on the keypads at drive up ATM's?	ATM machines are mass produced.  The hardware on every model is identical.  As a result, brail pads are applied to every machine since the factory doesn't know if it will end up in a drive thru or bolted onto a wall.  The enclosure, not the machine is the only thing different about drive thru and bolted units.	1	4
Why is there brail on the keypads at drive up ATM's?	It is actually cheaper for the manufacturer to make all ATMs with braille than to make different kinds.  It's all about saving a dollar.	1	3
Why is there brail on the keypads at drive up ATM's?	Well seriously...blind people use the bank too.  Maybe someone drives them there to use it or maybe they walk.  What are they supposed to do just sit at home and do nothing.	1	4
Why is there brail on the keypads at drive up ATM's?	Wow.. Spell it with me.... B-r-a-i-l-l-e. Not 'brail'. . It's so blind people who know Braille can operate the machine.. . And for all the people asking about the drive-thru ones.....if they're already making the machines with Braille, why make special machines without just for drive-thru ATM'S?. Think.	1	4
Why is there brail on the keypads at drive up ATM's?	Good question, and why are there braille keypads at DRIVE-UP ATMs????	0	2
Why is there brail on the keypads at drive up ATM's?	Maybe it would cost too much to manufacture different keypads for the drive through ATMs.  Another possibility is that a blind person may be a passenger and not a driver (like if they took a cab or something).	1	4
Why is there brail on the keypads at drive up ATM's?	"A drive-up ATM can be used by anyone.  Being a ""drive-up ATM"" doesnt mean you need to have a car to use it.. . I sometimes walk up to a drive-tru ATM, specially if Iam not the one driving."	1	4
Why is there brail on the keypads at drive up ATM's?	Hey, the way sighted people drive in my area, blind people would probably drive much better!! lol. . The ATMs legally have to have braille on them so blind people can get money as well. It has nothing to do with the ATM being drive-up.	1	4
Why is there brail on the keypads at drive up ATM's?	Why is there Braile at drive-up ATMs?. . . So Stevie Wonder can get some cash.	0	2
Why is there brail on the keypads at drive up ATM's?	"Drive-up ATM buttons are marked with braille because federal regulations require it.. .

Drive-up ATMs, unlike the walk-up variety, don't need to be wheelchair accessible, but the rules make no exception regarding accessibility by the blind."	1	4
Why is there brail on the keypads at drive up ATM's?	When America first gained independence, Europe said we'd never last cause we spent so much time sueing each other.  In the great American tradition, common sense does not apply to the civil courts.  In other words, the Americans with Disabilities Act requires everything be as accessable as possible, so the drive up ATM's have braile.. . Also, I believe they make ATM's the same way wherever they're ultimately going to put them, so when they make the machine they don't know it's going to be a drive-up one or not.  It would be rather silly to have a whole separate factory for drive up ATM's just so they didn't put braile on the keys.	1	4
Why is there brail on the keypads at drive up ATM's?	Drive-up ATM buttons are marked with braille ... one of those absurd points of principle, but ATM manufacturers say a fair number of blind people do take cabs to drive-up ATMs ...	1	4
Why is there brail on the keypads at drive up ATM's?	The keypads are not unique to drive-up tellers and ATM's. The use them for other applications.. But since you mention it, I always did wonder why a Ford product I rented once had braille on some of the steering wheel controls!	0	2
Why is there brail on the keypads at drive up ATM's?	"Drive-up ATM buttons are marked with braille because federal regulations require it. To be specific, section 4.34.4 of the ADA Accessibility Guidelines for Buildings & Facilities says, ""Instructions and all information for use [of an automated teller machine] shall be made accessible to and independently usable by persons with vision impairments."" Drive-up ATMs, unlike the walk-up variety, don't need to be wheelchair accessible, but the rules make no exception regarding accessibility by the blind.. . ...no matter how stupid they may be"	1	4
Why is there brail on the keypads at drive up ATM's?	Because all ATM's are made in the same factory, and they all have braile keypads, regardless of where they are intended to be installed.  It's just cheaper to make them that way.	1	3

Guarded means less about how they think he is going to do and more their opinion on what is going to happen is guarded. next is fair which basically means the patient should recover fine as long as they follow what the doctor tells them to but there is a small chance of difficulty. finally good condition means that there is no reason as to why the patient shouldn't fully recover.	0	1

Causes and effects of the rise of Christanity?	Put simply yes, If the crust of the earth under lake Erie where to rise or fall even just a few feet it could cause a Tasmania.  As you probably already know that is what caused the Tasmania on Christmas just a few years back, except that that earthquakee was so strong that it lifted the earth crust over 20 feet and caused a underwater land slide when that happened it caused a displacement of water,  So much that the water on one side of the quake caused the tide to rise, and on the other side of the quake the tide lowered that is the side that dose almost all the damage.  So Yes any earthquak underwater can and most likely will cause a tsunami of some kind.  I hope that this helps.	0	1

what is artificial intelligence?	AI is the creation of an adaptive network that is capable of acquiring information and utilizing it, e.i. a learning machine.  What makes humans so unique and dominant are the abilities to learn and create.  Computers can collect a vast amount of information (memory), and programs can use this information (brain).  However programs cannot change, thus they can only repeat their designed tasks, putting them on par with animal instincts.  However recently supercomputers show the ability to change those programs and thus adapting to the environment such as beating grand chess masters or exploring the Mars surface.  So far AI is on a basic level with advanced primates and early toddlers.  When AI reaches the level of self-awareness and making its own decisions, humans will become obsolete.	1	4

what is artificial intelligence?	"Emotional Intelligence, also called EI or EQ, describes an ability, capacity, or skill to perceive, assess, and manage the emotions of one's self, of others, and of groups. However, being a relatively new area, the definition of emotional intelligence is still in a state of flux. Some, such as John D. Mayer (2005a) prefer to distinguish emotional knowledge from emotional intelligence, as discussed below.. . In 1920, E. L. Thorndike, at Columbia University, (Thorndike 1920), used the term ""social intelligence"" to describe the skill of getting along with other people. In 1975, Howard Gardner's The Shattered Mind, (Gardner 1975) began the formulation of the idea for ""Multiple Intelligences"" (he identifies eight intelligences), including both interpersonal intelligence and intrapersonal intelligence. Many psychologists, such as Gardner, believe that traditional measures of intelligence, such as the IQ test, fail to fully explain cognitive ability. (Smith 2002). . The term ""emotional intelligence"" appears to have originated with Wayne Payne (1985), but was popularized by Daniel Goleman (1995). The leading research on the concept originated with Peter Salovey and John ""Jack"" Mayer starting in the late 1980s. In 1990, their seminal paper (1990) defined the concept as an intelligence. Mayer and Salovey continued to research the concept, and created an emotional intelligence test called the MSCEIT (Mayer-Salovey-Caruso Emotional Intelligence Test). The term ""emotional quotient"" seems to have originated in an article by Keith Beasley (1987). Bar-on (1997) developed a test measuring emotional quotient, called the Emotional Quotient Inventory (EQi). There are numerous other assessments of emotional intelligence each advocating different models and measures.. . I copied it from the site."	0	1
what is artificial intelligence?	Knowledge is factual information, things you learn. It is part of intelligence, but not the only facet of it.. . If you go with the theory that intelligence can be divided into crystal and fluid intelligence... crystal encompasses the knowledge (facts, information, recall, etc). Fluid intelligence is application, adaptation, and problem solving. . . The Wechsler scales look at a lot of different areas in determining IQ, they divide it into verbal and performance scores, and these are derived from several subtests, which also include processing speed, retention, and others. . . Here is a decent summary of the WAIS: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wechsler_Adult_Intelligence_Scale	0	1

what is artificial intelligence?	"Good question.. I will turn your question around. It is cunningness that is associated with intelligence. The person who is cunning will also be intelligent. An intelligent person may not be cunning.. . Intelligent is a person . 1. who does rational things and avoids irrational things. 2. Has a sound knowledge of something. 3. Has the capacity to acquire the knowledge of things. . Mind it, there can be intelligent gadgets too, which behave rationally. Rational also means logical. Such gadgets behave logically. That's why you have ""fuzzy logic"" found in many gadgets. Besides, there is something called artificial intelligence. Logic that is computed artificially. In all the senses, it is rationality that is intelligence. . . Cunningness : The ability to take immoral advantage of a situation such that others might even suffer. . . You cannot be non-intelligent but cunning, because cunningness involves a lot of logic. Infact it requires a logic superior than normal intelligent people. Many a times even intelligent people are conned (a word with same root as cunning). So, it is cunningness that is associated with intelligence.. . Intelligence is not always used for self gain only. The innovations, inventions and discoveries that make our life easy and make us SOCIAL from SAVAGE are the result of human intelligence (and not of human cunningness). So, there you see the difference.. . There can be (there should be, amen) a society with only intelligent people without anyone being cunning. But there cannot be a society with only cunning people but noone intelligent."	0	2
what is artificial intelligence?	Motivation feeds intelligence. You have your whole life to gain knowledge, but without motivation (desire), ignorance snowballs.

how can I hide the cuts on my wrists?	Since pulling takes more effort than pushing. When pulling, you must exert significant force on the door. When pushing, a lot of times you can use your whole body to push. Therefore, there is more force on your wrists when pulling. If you look at the way your wrists naturally hang when you lift your hand up, you will see that the fingers are set up to pull from the side. By following this natural position, the side pull puts less torque on your wrists and helps alleviate strains (especially when you pull on a locked door which can impart significant force on your wrists).	0	1

Why some men never wash their hands after using the Urinal/Toilet?	I think more women go than men.. Like a group of 4 go when only 1 needs. . And apparently women in general need to go to the loo more than men. They need to go for other reasons than getting the toilet like fixing hair makeup etc.. Also men go in and out generally and women take their time usually. Maybe if they go for a pee they'll stop and check their hair and I don't know about men but almost every woman washes their hands.. So there are even more queues inside.. Not to mention those bloody hand dryers take about 5 hours to work.. . . . PS- I've actually heard that the women's toilets sometimes have less or the same amount of cubicles than the mens. That doesn't make much sense to me, especially since you guys got urinals. I wonder if it's true.	0	2

Why some men never wash their hands after using the Urinal/Toilet?	Those toilets seats were made for bathrooms with out a urinal for men.  So when men sit on it, it is easier for them to do their second business.  If you know what I mean.  I'm trying to keep this clean okay.

Why some men never wash their hands after using the Urinal/Toilet?	The herpes virus can't live on it's own outside the human body for long, however... when you have an outbreak, you shouldn't share towels with anyone. It can live on a moist towel for a while after use. I have heard that it's not possible to spread it through a toilet seat, etc. You should practice very good hygeine however. Wash your hands after if you need to scratch. every time!! You can infect yourself further by touching your sores then touching your mouth!! 80% infection rate!!!! Wash your hands everytime with soap and hot water. Even when your sores are gone, you shed the virus at certain times with no symptoms. Always, always wash after touching or going to the bathroom, you have to consider yourself infective at all times even with no symptoms.	0	2

Why some men never wash their hands after using the Urinal/Toilet?	I would rather not touch the handle of the faucet when someone may have gotten their germs on their hands and then just rinsed them or didn't thouroughly clean them before touching it again to shut it off.  I will wash my hands in those bathrooms where the sink, soap and hand towels are automated so that you dont' have to touch anything.  I am a doctor myself and I always wash my hands in MY sink before touching a patient.  I don't wash my hands in public restrooms because I find it grosser to touch everyone elses germs than just have my own on me.  I have hand sanitizer in my purse I use when I leave the bathroom.  Don't be too quick to judge someone when they don't wash their hands in a public restroom.  That doesn't mean they aren't sanitizing when they leave.	1	4

Why some men never wash their hands after using the Urinal/Toilet?	Men and women must have different pee thresholds. I suppose its because half the men are out at some tree instead and they have urinals that they can crowd into too. Remember women are also looking after other things in their like periods. To my way of thinking they should just put twice as many loo's for women in the first place - problem solved. Which reminds me - why can't men get from A to B in a car without stopping to pee?	0	2

Why some men never wash their hands after using the Urinal/Toilet?	I call it the ladies room. Or the rest room since you rest on the toilet.I call it a bathroom when I am home because it is the room with the bath in it and happens to have the toilet in it. However when I am out in public I call it a restroom because it's much more polite sounding toilet. Toilet sounds, I don't know, gas station like. You could use that term with your best,trusted, honest friends. Sometimes people would say restroom because they might have to pop out a booger or wash their hands or see if their underwear are showing.	0	2
how are braces put on and do they hurt a lot?	Dental cement, it hurts some but it's not like you got stabbed, it's kind of like a dull ache when the wires get tightened...

how are braces put on and do they hurt a lot?	back in the days that i had braces, i was told, one Advil & one Tyenol. but now i bet one Alieve would do the trick and if they are poking you, buy wax and put it over whats hurting you. its worth it in the end hun, just be patient. this too shall pass	1	3
how are braces put on and do they hurt a lot?	"I had braces for three years. It was about 10 yrs ago and they used medical grade cement, little drops to adhere the metal to your teeth. I don't remember if it hurt to have them put on, but the monthly adjustments felt like I was teething. It was kind of an anxious feeling. I had 4 teeth pulled prior to getting them on, headgear as a child, an extra year of braces due to moving out of state and TONS of ""cranking."" I would do it all over though because I used to never smile, and since then I get compliments all the time... . My point: You'll be ok. A smile is one of the best gifts you can give someone. It doesn't hurt that bad, but the whole time you know you have a cool day to look forward to."	1	4

how are braces put on and do they hurt a lot?	The brackets are cemented to your teeth. That doesn't hurt, but the wires do. It's worth it though.	1	3
how are braces put on and do they hurt a lot?	They use a cement-like glue and put all the brackets on, then insert the wires. It did not hurt me getting them on, but my teeth were very sore and sensitive for about two or three days afterwards. The chains -- you'll probably get them later -- really hurt the first time too. I just got mine off, and that doesn't hurt either.. . Good luck... :)	1	4
how are braces put on and do they hurt a lot?	"I had braces for three years, and they didn't hurt.  Your teeth are shifting and sometimes that can cause headaches, but ""hurt"" is a strong word.  You will feel minor discomfort when they get tighten, but nothing too serious.  In fact, swolling a aspirn or taking a tylenol will help you, if you are uncomfortable. By the way, once you get your braces off, you will feel good about the entire process.  Your smile is worth it."	1	4
how are braces put on and do they hurt a lot?	"You would know yourself if you need braces.  Most people don't ""need"" braces but want them.  Or are you asking if your problem could be corrected by something other than braces?"	0	2
how are braces put on and do they hurt a lot?	they are not that bad once you have them on. it takes a while, they have to cement them to your teeth, with brackets, wires. stuff also gets caught in them too. but you will like the outcome of you nice teeth. some of the wires can bug you and you have to take really good care of your teeth with them.	1	3
how are braces put on and do they hurt a lot?	i don't think they differ. . . I had them for a year. They have like a container (made for your teeth) and they put glue on your teeth first to make them stay and then they push the container up and the braces are one they use a light to have the glue dry faster then they make the wire and they cut to fit your mouth and if something hurts just tell the orthodontist	1	3

how are braces put on and do they hurt a lot?	I am not quite sure I know what you are asking exactly, but I am assuming that you mean what could cause braces to not be affectiven and help teeth.  if someone misses an appt with the orthodontist, and dont get their rubberbands or use them, or dont get the wires switched out (each time you go and they switch the wire, it's a different gauge of thickness and it causes the teeth to get pulled closer and closer together everytime.  If they dont go do that, the braces wont work, and after the braces are off, if the person doesnt wear their retainer at all, the braces were a waste completely because the retainer coaxes their them together every night.	0	2
how are braces put on and do they hurt a lot?	Well, the way my brother became a food critic was to take some of my homemade biscuits outside and used them as hockey pucks. It really hurt my feelings, but I put in a lot of very long hard hours and became a gourmet cook	0	1

how are braces put on and do they hurt a lot?	I wouldn't advise doing it.  However, I did it when I was 15...only had the braces on for 3 mos.  My mother worked for the ortho and it cost her nothing.  I used pliers and tweezers.  It took a long time to get them all off but I did it.  My teeth wern't damaged in the least.  I only had them on for a tiny space between my 2 front ones.  But, don't do it.  Someone has probably paid a lot of $$$ for those braces and they may just kick your butt.	1	3

What do you order at Taco Bell?	i used to work at a taco bell on a military base, and for the most part, we had a LOT of return customers, mainly because the taco bell was on a military base. a lot of people there were so used to it, maybe its just because its a grade of food that is still safe to eat, its just processed to the point that your body reacts adversely to it and you get the upset stomach and such.	0	2
What do you order at Taco Bell?	taco bell is not a global dinning chain as of yet. you see, to have sucess selling food in forgen countrys the resteraunt has to hire a hole new set of reps to focus on what that paticular country would like to see.. such as mcdonalds for example. they have hired people specificly to relate to the children in other countrys so that they can have toys that they want. they aslo specialize the menue. so that it includes regional foods. apparently taco bell hasnet gone up to that standard yet, just wait, i'm sure it will get there eventualy!. so if you really want taco bell.. then i would suggest coming to america for a week or so just to check out our not so great fast food!	0	2

What do you order at Taco Bell?	Because Taco Bell is giving away all their ancient secrets.. . Taco Bell is in fact the finest Mexican food that money can buy and they can't stand to see it sold so cheaply.. . It is pure envy and selfishness because they don't want to share their delicious gorditas and nachos bellgrande with us gringos.. . Did you know: the bell on the Taco Bell logo is the actual bell hung in the first church built by the Spanish in Mexico?  It was built near Mexico City to convert the Aztecs.. . So you see, everything about Taco Bell is authentic and goes right to the heart of Mexican culture.  Go there and immerse yourself in the Mexican experience:  Taste the history.  Savor the cross-cultural understanding.  Discover the soul of our neighbor to the south.  Make a run for the border.	0	2
What do you order at Taco Bell?	I like to get the taco salad, but if I don't get that then I get the Nacho's Bell Grande, 1 soft taco, a carmel apple empanada and a pepsi with lots of ice.  .

What do you order at Taco Bell?	While, I myself have a craving for Taco Bell every so often (I'm here in the States) you really aren't missing that much.

Enjoy the local cuisine or buy a packet of taco seasoning and knock yourself out!	0	2
why do we go to school if in the real world we dont use most of it?	Most of what we learn is school is used in the real world.. School allows you to find out what you're good at, what you like doing, what you don't.. You learn to socialize and relate to others.. It is very useful, especially if u want to go to college.. . Now, if ur goals in life are sitting on a couch and watching tv, yeah  school is pointless.	1	4

why do we go to school if in the real world we dont use most of it?	I don't know the history, but I do know it is a famous school in Bangladesh, situated in Dhaka. It is considered one of the top high schools in Bangladesh along with Ideal School & Viqarunnesa School.. . It is located near Dhaka College, Dhaka. I studied in Ideal School & College, and every year my school had real competition with this school in results of SSC exams.	0	1
why do we go to school if in the real world we dont use most of it?	School is not just for practical learning, such as adding 2+2.  Learning about history, language, arts, abstract mathmatics, etc, makes people more intellegent, more decisive, and more succeful in life.  When you learn about something, you may not use it in real life, but it will certainly open your eyes to something new, therefore making you more aware of the world you live in giving you a greater ability to make judgements in your own life and career because you have a heighten sense of awarness.. . Someone who has gone to only ninth grade as opposed to someone who has gotten their associates degree have vastly different views of the world.  The person with more education is more aware and can make judgement about life in general with a more aware state of mind then the person without it.. . That is why education institutions teach things that we don't use everyday.  We really do use those things, just not practically.	1	4
why do we go to school if in the real world we dont use most of it?	Our schools are primarily just socialized babysitting.	0	2
why do we go to school if in the real world we dont use most of it?	School helps prepare us for the real world. Sad thing is, most people don't realize this or care. They mispell words, write choppy english, etc... Then when they get older, they can't organize things, figure their checkbooks, etc... They have no concept of history, and may believe strange things, like some people that don't believe in the Holocaust.	1	3
why do we go to school if in the real world we dont use most of it?	"You would be surprised how much of it you use, and which parts of it you use.  As others have said, it's not so much what you learn, but that you learn how to think well and how to learn.    If you are questioning school, I suggest you take a look at the book ""The Teenager's Guide to the Real World"" - it is very enlightening about school and lots of other stuff that may seem stupid or silly to you right now, but will become invaluable to you as you grow older (see link below...)"	1	4
why do we go to school if in the real world we dont use most of it?	The most important thing  we learn in school is 'how to learn'. This is what we use when we are out there in life, on the job, on the street, in our home. After that, it depends on what we want to do with our lives.	1	4

why do we go to school if in the real world we dont use most of it?	So you are not ignorant!. .      Although you may not use all of it and maybe even forget most of what you learn in school, you will use some when you work.. .      Construction you must have a basic understanding of math and to get better pay you have to be able to read and have a good understanding of numbers.. .      A physician has to have basic knowledge about other countries so she/he can diagnose his/her patient if the patient had come in contact with some type of disease. Once again math (for prescriptions dosage related to weight and so forth) science, and English are crucial.. .      People that work in fast food also need to understand basic language and math skills.. .      Also by going to school we achieve social skills, very important to everyone.. .      Go as far as you can because what you may want to do now may not be what you want to do in the future.	1	4
why do we go to school if in the real world we dont use most of it?	"""They"" say we go to school to get a ""balanced"" education, and to learn to interact socially with our peers.  No, we don't need algebra to work at Walmart--we do not need to be able to identify works of art to work at McDonalds--we do not need history to work construction.  . . Apparently, ""they"" hope that we will learn something that will interest us enough to pursue in life."	1	4
why do we go to school if in the real world we dont use most of it?	You use all of it.. . What you gain from classes like literature and math is a WAY of thinking and problem-solving, which will help you avoid lots of difficulties later. You may not use the obvious content (e.g. graphing the area under a sine curve), but you will be using the problem-solving logic to reason through faster solutions to every day problems.. . Most people, however, when they are in the middle of using those skills, directly link their ability to reason with the exercises they did in their childhood academic classes.	1	4
why do we go to school if in the real world we dont use most of it?	a lot of thing you learn in school is to open your mind and to teach your mind to problem solve and that is very imporant (ie math and sciences)...also some of the stuff (ie history) is so you know what happen in the past so you can learn for other peoples mistakes...you also need to know how to speak problerly and expand you mind to all of the wonderful thing that are in books (ie english)...that is why you need the basic the other thing most schools call electives are just so you can maybe learn what you want to do for aliveing if you are not going to a college.	1	4

why do we go to school if in the real world we dont use most of it?	Trust me I thought the same thing in school.  You will use a lot of it in the real world!  Social skills, math, science, history etc...  You will be able to understand the real world better if you go to school even if you don't think you're learning much now!  I realized this recently being a mom and wife now.  I have to deal with the real world(social skills), pay bills(math), understand what's going on in the world (history), be a mom (social skills, science, health),And all kinds of stuff come into play from what you learned in school!  School may also help you decide who you want to become later in life, just go through it and finish it, it will pay off later even if you don't go to college, High School is something everyone should finish!	1	4
why do we go to school if in the real world we dont use most of it?	They don't know how to react with the real world	0	2
why do we go to school if in the real world we dont use most of it?	I don't get it -- you have plenty of real-world experience that might be better in many ways than academic experience.. . Talk to the school you want to go to and ask them.  They'll probably recommend that after you get into the program you'll have to take some make-up courses in computer science foundation topics, which could add a year or two to your degree, but getting in shouldn't be a problem.	1	3

why do we go to school if in the real world we dont use most of it?	yes, most jobs now days like it if you have a college degree, they will pay you more, and its how america plans to compete in the global world, with foriegn schools learning more at a younger age we have to keep learning things past high school in order to be caught up with them. College is a good opertunity to learn who you are, thats why I think people should go to college, it gives you a transition between high school were your kinda protected by your parents and the real world were you are supposed to know everything, even though most fake it. I think its a good opertunity for people that we take advantage of.	1	3
why do we go to school if in the real world we dont use most of it?	"As a former ""tardy"" student I would simply tell them; if they do not wish to receive a bad grade and not graduate then be tardy all they want. Showing up late does not make it in the real world, and you are preparing them for the real world. Make absentee's and tardy's part of their grade. Don't forget to tell them that their potential employers will be calling for a reference."	0	2
why do we go to school if in the real world we dont use most of it?	Because the school system is outdated. It is set up to teach the basics like math, spelling, geography, etc. Some schools do touch upon things like loans and budgeting but most don't. Also it seems many students are more interested in their social lives, What Paris or Lyndsey did in the tabloids than what is going on in the world. Just ask a teen what states border theirs and 90% will not know the answer. Parents need to teach their children life nessesities, not the schools.	1	3
why do we go to school if in the real world we dont use most of it?	"to get you in to habit of working every day... in the ""real"" world, you have to work everyday and make a living, even when you don't feel like it... plus learing is essential for everyday living even after school os over... every job you have, you will learn something new.  People who do not get used to learning, do not do well in life..."	1	3
why do we go to school if in the real world we dont use most of it?	Well, actually I am quite familiar with it.. Apparently you don't go to school either, hence you're terrible spelling and grammar.. However, I do believe that sometimes the world is the best school.. Please don't be so sure that people don't know or understand what you're talking about. Gypsy is a common word and something that I have studied about intensely.	0	1
why do we go to school if in the real world we dont use most of it?	cause the government and big corporate CEO's and upper management don't want any competition in the future when students get into the real world.	0	2
why do we go to school if in the real world we dont use most of it?	There are 2 reasons for it.. One, is it helps you learn the material better.  You can take more time at home to re-read it.  You're too rushed at school.. . The other reason has nothing to do with school.  Homework is getting you used to the real world after you leave school.. We always have bills to pay, taxes and negotiations in writing with people in our work place and in buying a home, etc.. . It's like doing your chores that your parents made you do.  To get you used to it.. . Believe me, when you get out on your own, you'll have more homework than ever.  They're preparing you for the shock.. . You'll never escape it.	1	4
Why do some people only go to church on Easter Sunday and never go again until Christmas ?	christmas and easter are the two most revered season in the catholic liturgical year.while the church requires that weekly church attendance is best, perhaps some people think birth and death are reasons worthy of celebrating and better that celebration than nothing at all. it's like an exercise plan for the new year that peters out after a month. of course that is when they can show off their new clothes.oh no'	1	4

Why do some people only go to church on Easter Sunday and never go again until Christmas ?	"Because Christmas has become a cultural holiday associated with spending time with family.  It is the only ""Christian"" holiday to also be a U.S. government holiday, by the way.  In the tradition of American culture, we spend time with our families.  Some churches have given into that idea of Christmas and are encouraging it by closing on Christmas and on Sunday.. . I am a church leader myself, and in my tradition we always worship on Sunday, and we always worship on Christmas.  So, my church will be open.  That doesn't make us any better than anyone else, its just that we see Christmas as a holiday of the church rather than a family holiday (like Mother's Day or something)."	1	4

If Christmas Eve is a Sunday, it is counted as the fourth Sunday of Advent, with Christmas Eve proper beginning at sundown."	0	1
Why do some people only go to church on Easter Sunday and never go again until Christmas ?	There are 2 days which use the term Easter-Easter Sunday and Easter Monday (the day after 'Easter').  Although the Sunday is always the day that Easter itself is actually celebrated, the Monday is often a holiday.  Maybe you should try looking at it another way, rather than the term Easter Sunday describing Easter as being on a Sunday, it may be describing a Sunday which is Easter as no other Sundays in a year are ever Easter. Thats 2 different perspectives to consider it from.	0	2

Why do some people only go to church on Easter Sunday and never go again until Christmas ?	I believe that we go to church to satisfy ourselves and not God.

I go to church almost every Sunday because I want to.	1	4

Why do some people only go to church on Easter Sunday and never go again until Christmas ?	It's better than not going to church at all I guess.  People consider Sunday part of their weekend -- their time to do whatever they want basically -- rather than as the day God set aside to be the Sabbath.  But they nonetheless want to be good people so they go on Easter and Christmas, because those are the days they think it's most important for them to go.  They simply don't think its important for them to go every sunday.	1	4
Why do some people only go to church on Easter Sunday and never go again until Christmas ?	I think it is because they want to seem like they actually care some about christ. But they don't believe enough to go to church every sunday (and wednesday.). But they know churches usually have something special going on for christmas and easter and they would like to see it, but church isn't that important to go every sunday/wednesday or they just say they're too busy and they'll get around to it when they can.	1	4

The only difference could be is food.  But most people do about the same thing.  Boil eggs, color them, eat the, eat candy, get new clothes, dress up easter sunday, go to church, be with the family.	0	2
Why do some people only go to church on Easter Sunday and never go again until Christmas ?	Because they are bigots.  These are the people that think church is something they only have to do on Sundays and holidays.  These are the people that we should feel sorry for.  I am not much for organized religion but I am not against it.  What I am against are these people that go once or twice every 3 or 4 months and think this is their key to heaven.  Maybe I am wrong, but I don't think so, ignorance is bliss.	1	4
Why do some people only go to church on Easter Sunday and never go again until Christmas ?	That's actually a pretty simple question to answer. It's amazing how many people think that if they accept Christ into their life, that God - through osmosis or something - gives them EVERYTHING they need to know about how to live their life.  A good percentage of people out there have extremely shallow relationships with God - and they don't know it.. . Christianity is about relationship with Christ. That relationship takes time to develop, and it won't develop just by going to church on sunday only - and CEO Christians (Christmas and Easter only) are the WORST!. . But, they have been accepted by God, and that, you must respect.	0	2
Why do some people only go to church on Easter Sunday and never go again until Christmas ?	To me, taking Christ out of Christmas is like taking the menorah out of Hanukkah.  To say that they can't be called Christmas Trees any more (but must be Holiday Trees instead) is just as insulting as someone calling a menorah a candle-holder.. . I was very glad to see that it's still being called Christmas In Rockefeller Center last night.  If it had been Happy Holidays In Rockefeller Center, I would have thrown a fit.  . . I think, if it is a Christmas Festival, people should definitely be allowed to call it that.  If you're not Christian, you really have no business being at a Christmas Festival.  If you prefer a Holiday Festival, whatever, but if they are choosing to call it a Christmas Festival, then it should be about CHRISTMAS and not trying to make people of all religions happy.. . It's only a matter of time before Easter gets attacked too... well, you already see big pink bunnies all over the place... OK, never mind.  Easter has already lost its Christian meaning.  You never see signs that say Resurrection Sale Extravaganza, just as we're seeing far less signs that say Christmas Extravaganza.  Pretty soon, Easter is going to melt into the HOLIDAY pile of mush.. . When it does, I think the world will be much worse off.  Just as we are now, with Christmas becoming just another Holiday.	0	2
Why do some people only go to church on Easter Sunday and never go again until Christmas ?	"I never understood why people go to church 3 times a week anyway.  Especially TWICE in one day(Sunday morning/Sunday night).  I really think you could grow more as a christian by spending the time helping others (IE volunteering at a shelter, nursing home, animal rescue, etc.)  I think going to church on Sunday morning only is perfectly fine.  It makes me sick people WASTE their time just sitting their butts on the church pew and not gaining anything out of it.  I bet Alot of people who are ""church-a-holics"" (as I call them) probably can't even tell what the sermon was about the second they walk out the church doors. What is the point in going 3 times a week if you are ""bored"" b/c I know you aren't listening when your there. I think churches should as a group on Sunday nights go to an organization where people are in need and help them INSTEAD of having another service and TAKING UP ANOTHER OFFERING.  . AND HERES ANOTHER THOUGHT......... You said your bored....ok....again why go then?  Do you think you are fooling GOD?  While you may be able to fool other people by going to church 3 times a week- you can't fool GOD.  He knows you dont want to be there.  . . You need to find something that will enrich your spirituality and help you grow in the Lord -- and only you will know what that is. Pray and ask the Lord to help you find it.  Good Luck."	1	3
Why do some people only go to church on Easter Sunday and never go again until Christmas ?	Since like 99.9% of Italy is Roman Catholic they go to mass(church) Easter Morning. Plus they start on Palm Sunday which is actually a week before easter, or wait, I think it started Ash Wednesday they're supposed to fast for 40 days before Easter, but most just give up something they like to eat alot, like say veal or pasta or wine etc. Anyways on Easter Sunday there is a big meal served with red wine, and most gather with family and the women all wear black, as a sign of mourning for the death of Jesus. Not really a celebration though.	0	2
Why do some people only go to church on Easter Sunday and never go again until Christmas ?	"Hate to break your Easter egg, but ""Easter Sunday"" is not truly redundant, but rather a clarification for more precise language.  . . Easter:  Easter is a more generic term that can apply to the entire season of the church year that lasts fifty days.  The term, ""Easter Sunday"" would therefore be the precise method of designating which day of the fifty day period we are talking about, much as ""Christmas Day"" designates December 25 from the more generic Christmas season. (Beginning to look a lot like ""Christmas"", ""Christmas"" time, getting ready for ""Christmas"", etc.). . As for 12 noon and 12 midnight, this is probably more a function of the need for colloquial redundancy in our spoken language (yes, I realize that was redundant) and also the fact that we are often designating morning or evening for the times we give -- 3 in the afternoon, 3 in the morning, so we act out of habit.  Much of our language is redundant so that we can effectively communicate.  Just think how small the information of this paragraph actually is when reduced electronically because of its redundancy.  It doesn't mean that I should type this out in ones and zeros however.  Information theory has exposed just how redundant our language is and how important reduncancy is for accuracy and clarity.. . As for the hot water heater, you probably never took a science class or you would realize that thermodynamics requires the hot water to be heated or it will get cold.. . Oh and one more thing, I'm a proponent of redundancy since it enhances clarity, but isn't it redundant to write the following:  ""Either midnight or noon will suffice, I'm well aware that it's 12 either way.""  You could have said: ""Either midnight or noon will suffice."" or ""I'm well aware that it's 12 either way.""  Aren't those pretty much the same thing?. . Happy Easter Sunday."	0	2
Why do some people only go to church on Easter Sunday and never go again until Christmas ?	"In the 4th Century, Emperor Constantine had a dream that if he put a cross on his soldiers shields, they would be victorious. After winning a battle (a war?) he made Christianity the official state religion throughout his empire. He decreed that people must desecrate the Sabbath & honor Sunday, ""the venerable day of the sun god."" No mention of Jesus, God, or anything Christian! He & his mother chose Dec 25 (the winter solstice celebration of the ""birth"" of the sun god) as the time to celebrate Christmas - and a lot of pagan traditions. One of his church councils (which banned any Jewish bishops of the church) decided  that they would  scrap Passover as a schedule for celebrating Easter & chose to base in on the vernal equinox - for the goddess Ashtar/Ishtar... which is where the word ""Easter"" originated.. . Pope Sylvester I was a puppet for Constantine; he rubber stamped all of Constantine's heresies (clearly against God's Law & will), claiming that the Pope has the power & authority to change God's Law!. . The believers who followed the Way of the Torah-observant Messiah were shut-out. Constantine & the Pope co-opted the term 'Christianity' for their own use: the Cult of Constantine Church - but is ~sounds more respectable~ as the ""Holy Roman Catholic Church."""	0	2

They are very helpful to people in Australia.. . I have kids around your childrens age and I find they love some simple things we do at Christmas such as baking christmas cookies.  We go to church on christmas morning and also look for any local events such as carols by candlelight etc that are free and create wonderful family traditions.  Kids this age are also delighted to make hand made cards for other family members.. . Make your children aware of the real reason for christmas - the wonderful gift that God gave all people by sending Jesus to save us from our sins.  This is the greatest gift you can ever give them.	1	3
