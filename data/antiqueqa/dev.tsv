Why would a child's psychologist recommend hospitalization to develop social skills?	He needs in-patient help. If his parents can't help him (outpatient) then I think it's appropriate for him to be hospitalized so he can see what he's doing to his body. He's only 11 with anorexia, he needs this help.	1	4

Why would a child's psychologist recommend hospitalization to develop social skills?	Whatever issue is causing this is still elusive to the Doctor. I'm assuming the patient is making little/no progress in thier current treatment. Under constant supervision, the patient can be observed more closely in a variety of real-life situations, possibly exposing core problems and strengths to be built on.	1	4
Why would a child's psychologist recommend hospitalization to develop social skills?	I don't see how hospitalization is going to develop social skills.. Are you referring to an inpatient hospital for children with mental health issues who would be in a group setting interacting with other children with mental health issues? I would get a second opinion before putting your child in the hospital to develop social skills.  The larger issues, in my opinion, are the anorexia----very serious, and his refusing to go to school. Your child does need help. Why don't you get a 2nd opinion from a good psychiatrist or other mental health professional who is trained to work with children with mental health issues.	1	4
Why would a child's psychologist recommend hospitalization to develop social skills?	Because once he sees how crazy the people in the hospital are he'll probably straighten up.	0	2

How do you safely wean a person off Risperidal?	the weaning has to be done by the doctor. if you feel that SHE was put on it for the wrong reasons then she should get a second or third opinion doctors are people and can make mistakes. However it is a drug and incorrectly taking someone off can lead to withdrawal symptoms and health risk both mental and physical. The point is to do what is best for that person, getting a a second opinion and talking to the prescribing doctor is the best choice.	1	4
How do you safely wean a person off Risperidal?	I take Risperidal and I am not bipolar.  Yes I have had problems when I have run out of medication.  You(she) needs to consult a doctor and follow the doctor's instructions.	1	3
How do you safely wean a person off Risperidal?	Unless you are a medical doctor, you need to STOP right now--otherwise you are practicing medicine without a license which is illegal. Bipolar disorder is not the only diagnosis that Risperdal is used for. If this person doesn't feel comfortable taking it, then she should talk with her doctor about it and make the decision as to how to proceed. Frankly, I am appalled to read your question here.	1	4
How do you safely wean a person off Risperidal?	This is very serious, you can't just stop taking anti-psychotic drugs without permission from a psychitrist.. . Why?. . Because it gets worse if you stop taking it and re-take it, it takes more time to be recovered.. Sometimes even worse, when you stop taking it, once you re-take it's no longer working.	0	2
How do you safely wean a person off Risperidal?	When weaning off a psychotropic drug, it is best to consult the doctor as to the proper way to do it.  The doctor should tell you how to taper off even if s/he doesn't agree with your decision to do so.	1	4
How do you safely wean a person off Risperidal?	This should never be done without a doctor. I was on risperdol for anxiety attacks and i took myself off and i did have withdraw from it but i was lucky and after about a week it stopped but i only took them 1 time a day and i wasn't on a strong dose either. so be very careful as i think you need to get a doctor involved even if you have to go to a different doctor just to be on the safe side.	1	4

Why haven't Muslims protested the terrorism by radical Islam like they did the Cartoon Jihad?	I am a Muslim. I am even against protesting against those cartoons. Muslims were indirectly advertising the cartoons world over. Also, there is no meaning in boycotting danish products. The most a muslim should have done is to stop reading that newspaper.. .

Why haven't Muslims protested the terrorism by radical Islam like they did the Cartoon Jihad?	lol sand niggers	0	1
Why haven't Muslims protested the terrorism by radical Islam like they did the Cartoon Jihad?	I am a Muslim and I think Muslims were way out of order in the way they reacted to the cartoons, their is no excuse for that kind of violence and disorderly behavior.  Personally feel the prophet Mohammed peace and blessings of God be upon him would have been disgusted!  I think a peace full protest would have been good because the cartoons were very offensive.. . With regards to the Terrorists a lot of prominent Muslim figures have denounced the terrorism publicly.  But all real practicing Muslims are against these terrorists, but there not goin onto the streets. . . The Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings be upon him) said about not being anxious to engage in the battlefield and to pray for peace and security instead.  . . If we studied honestly and objectively the life of the Prophet from authentic and unbiased sources we will find that he never engaged in the battlefield nor did he approve of battles other than to repel aggression, including legitimate pre-emptive strike against pending attack, or to stop aggression or persecution.  . . It is known that the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) lived in a very simple and self-imposed simplicity like any poor person lived. When he died he owned virtuously nothing. Even on his deathbed he insisted that whatever money he had must be given to the poor.	1	4
Why haven't Muslims protested the terrorism by radical Islam like they did the Cartoon Jihad?	Who killed more civilians (that's what terror is) in the recent (a few hundred years) known history? Huh? What? The terror done by a few drug dealer moron Afghanis is a drop in the ocean.	0	2

Why haven't Muslims protested the terrorism by radical Islam like they did the Cartoon Jihad?	What ever is more convenient to them or serves their purpose.  Just look at the Christian Right and their protest with the Terry Schivo case.  They were so valiant with their protest for her but at the same time they were calling in death threats to the governor and you sure don't see them protesting at executions.	1	4
Why haven't Muslims protested the terrorism by radical Islam like they did the Cartoon Jihad?	because what Muslims did in response to the cartoons (burning and killing) is wrong according to the Islam law.	1	3
Why haven't Muslims protested the terrorism by radical Islam like they did the Cartoon Jihad?	Study the history of the Muslim religion,you will also find the christian religion is the same way	1	3
Why haven't Muslims protested the terrorism by radical Islam like they did the Cartoon Jihad?	May of them have protested it, but you were apparently too ignorant to notice.	1	3
Why haven't Muslims protested the terrorism by radical Islam like they did the Cartoon Jihad?	"Good point u came too, . Why? , . i think because for The prophet cartoons, these cartoons were a direct insult for most precious person for any muslim in the world,so how ever how the person is educated he&#92;she will understand the insult and will protest against it. . . then why this doesnt' happen for terrorism?... i think this have many reasons,. 1. the most remarakable terrorism action is 9/11 and it was against americans, and many muslims dont like americans, so they didnt care that 2000 americans were dead, then the question why they dont like americans? for this answer check this : http://answers.yahoo.com/question/;_ylt=Ah3tUGeQCVPkY2mLcZSIecjsy6IX?qid=1006041322001. . 2.Many islamic leaders already objected on the terrorism actions and trying there best to stop it. . . 3.For the muslim youth (at least as i see them in my country), why protesting against terrorism which kills americans and israelians, in the time those americans and israeilans are killing muslims in afganistan, Iraq and were killing then since 50 years in palastine and STILL killing them there till now, so we do they protest ?, by their way of thinking, it's just justice! . . That doesn't mean that terrorism is accepted at all, just when u r attacked and killed and your land is taken and occupied dont expect that those occuped people will go and protest for the occuper rights ? that doesn't make sence right ? . . 4. For me ( I am a muslim girl) i would like very much to go and protest against terrorism , but you dont undestand that protesting and making demonestration is something very hard in here, and would lead to many bad results, it's not easy at all to go and say ""No for terrorism"" the way the police and government deals with demonestrations in here still needs great developing to be really modern.. .  I hope you got the others point of view about the whole matter."	1	4
Why haven't Muslims protested the terrorism by radical Islam like they did the Cartoon Jihad?	a good question!!. well Islam is not the religion of terrorism and i must admit that Muslims did a very bad thing by protesting against i don't say protest is bad but protest in a way that there mustn't be any death or any causalities around protesting against Denmark didn't effect the Denmark as it affects the Muslims countries where the protests held..they(Muslims) encountered a lot of death causalities by the protesting its only the Imams who protest these things and give a wrong view to the innocent Muslims that if u don't protest u r a non-Muslim i wanna ask Muslims they are always doing bad deeds against Islam but wen it comes to some thing like cartoons or what so ever they protest in a such a ruide way that a lot of causalities occur. i wanna say in the last there a lot of facts about Muhammad)PB UH) are there explained in the Holy Quran that He suffered a lot form non-muslims of that ERA but He didnt wish for any death causilites from them infact God(Allah) ask Him much to wish for any casulities but He refused.. The only thing is that muslims are not following their religion completly they only follow the Islamic points which are an easy task for them.	1	4
how sun rises?	well actually the magic yellow hippos push it along a track in the sky.. If you look directly at the sun as it rises you can see them. Make sure you squint.	1	4
how sun rises?	Because the Earth is rotating on its axis in an anti-clockwise direction, the sun appears to traverse the sky in a clockwise direction. Until it meets the horizon and seems to disappear below it, sunset, as the Earth rotates the horizon towards the East meets the sun, apparent sunrise or dawn.	1	4
how sun rises?	the sun doesn't rise..the earth just rotates giving the illusion of a sunrise and a sunset...	1	4
how sun rises?	the earth rotates and you see it like it is rising.	1	4
how sun rises?	Sun rise and sun fall are due to the rotation of the earth about its own axis.  . . Or if your an ancient egyptian the pharao makes the sun rise :)	1	4
how are DNA and RNA similar?	-Both DNA and RNA are nucleic acids.. - Their building blocks are nucleotides.. - They both have phosphate.. - They both have a 5-C sugar eventhough the sugar is different(deoxyribose in DNA and ribose in RNA). - They both have 4 nitrpgeneous bases.. - 3 of the bases are common to both: adenine, cytosine and guanine.	1	4
how are DNA and RNA similar?	DNA Double helix, 2 polynucleotides, Thymine, Deoxyribose    RNA  Single helix, 1 polynucleotide,  Uracil, Ribose (O extra). Both have                  .             adenine, cytosine & guanine	1	4
how are DNA and RNA similar?	The both have a ribose-phosphate chain, they are both nucleic acids, they both have bases, though RNA uses Uracil. They both encode who the organism is. Humans have both.	1	4
how are DNA and RNA similar?	Thats so simple. . 1: DNA is a double stranded helically coiled molecule. It is made up of a backbone of deoxyribose sugar and phosphate group and the links are made up of sugars purines and pyrimidenes. there are two purines:- Adenine and Guanine & two pyrimidenes:- Cytosine and Thymine. A combines with T and G combines with C.. Whereas RNA is single stranded and Thymine is replaced by Uracil.. 2: DNA makes RNA by transcription and RNA makes proteins by translation. . 3: DNA is the genetic material in most of the organisms whereas RNA is the genetic material in some RNA-viruses only. . 4: DNA is of 2 types according to functiom and placement: . linear (nuclear) and circular (organeller). According to the shape and turns, DNA is of 7 types but RNA is of a 3 types: ribosomal, nuclear, transfer.. 5: DNA can replicate itself but RNA needs to convert itself into DNA and then replicates.	1	4
how are DNA and RNA similar?	DNA contains all of the genetic information necessary to construct cells, to integrate them into an organism and to maintain them. RNA translates this information into specific instructions for the assembly of proteins, transmits the information outside the cell nucleus and helps to assemble them. Each DNA molecule contains hundreds of millions of atoms in a specific and unique sequence. The DNA molecule is shaped like a ladder twisted into a spiral, like a telephone cord. The rungs of the ladder are molecules called nucleotides; the rail of the ladder consists of alternating molecules of sugar and phosphate. There are four nucleotides, each of which is half of a complementary base pair. Each nucleotide fits into its mate on the opposite rail like two pieces of a jigsaw puzzle. When a cell reproduces a segment of the DNA ladder unzips. The base pairs separate and expose the nucleotides. Each exposed nucleotide attracts its complement from chemicals present in the cell nucleus. The result is two new ladders, each of which is identical to the original. At other times short sections of DNA unzip to expose a certain sequence of base pairs, called a gene. This is where RNA comes in. RNA is similar to DNA in some ways. Nucleotides in RNA are held together by sugars and phosphates. RNA differs from DNA in that each RNA molecule is only a single strand of nucleotides, and is much shorter. An RNA molecule is created by matching the sequence of exposed nucleotides on the unzipped DNA molecule. The RNA is an inverse copy of the gene, like a negative film image. Encoded in it is the information which will be decoded and translated to make the proteins which form the basis of life. Our physical being is an assemblage of thousands of proteins of various types. Structural materials like skin, claws, nails, bones, hair, muscles and the hard bodies of insects and shellfish are proteins. Enzymes are proteins, as are chemicals like insulin and hemoglobin. Proteins are the chemicals of life. The proteins and nucleotide sequence is slightly different for each individual. The types of proteins and the length of DNA are different for each species. But we share with all other people and all other forms of life the same set of amino acids, the same nucleotides and the same genetic code.	1	4
why do parakeets bounce up and down?	It's a way of body language communication and expression, in a flock body language has alot to do with lifestyle, the reasons behind the behavior can stretch from challenging dominance to attracting a mate, to simple social interaction.

why my neighbor's dog doesn't bark?	"I knew a lady a few years back that had a dog which it's voice box had been removed.  Apparently he was quite the ""barker"" as you put it! As far as your neighbors dog, well, you'd really have to ask your neighbor!!"	1	4

why my neighbor's dog doesn't bark?	some dogs just aren't barkers, whereas others you just can't shut the little ******** up! Also depends on the breed of dog too.  I have a staffordshire terrier, he's nearly 5 and he never barks.  The only time he does is when I turn the hose on and he runs under the running water.  He loves it, but he's very much a dumbarse of a dog.  And that's why I love him so!!	1	4

IF Jimmy Hoffa is found on the farm, how will it change American culture?	It won't change much at all. So some jokes or references may go away, but not many people make Jimmy Hoffa references anymore. Things have changed in history with no signifigant change to comedy because comedy is always changing with new comics anyway. New jokes (hopefully) are being created to replace old ones.	1	4

What does North by North-West mean?	Just like northwest is halfway between north and west, north-northwest is halfway between north and northwest.  Here's everything: north, south, east, west, northeast, northwest, southeast, southwest, north-northeast, east-northeast, east-southeast, south-southeast, south-southwest, west-southwest, west-northwest, and north-northwest.  A wind blowing from west to east I believe is called a westerly wind.  Winds are named by the direction they come from, not which way they're going.	1	4
What does North by North-West mean?	"This is the title of a movie by Alfred Hitchcock...directionally, north by northwest doesn't mean a thing.  . . The title North by Northwest refers to a compass direction that does not exist (the correct term is ""North-northwest"").  North-northwest on a compass is at 337.50°.. . What these directions are called on the compass can be found in this link: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing_the_compass"	1	4
What does North by North-West mean?	North by North-west is an older way of saying a certain direction on a compass.. Example: The line that divides North and West is called Northwest, right?. If you were to draw another line between North and your new Northwest line, that would be considered 'the line that is North of Northwest' or 'North by Northwest' or today would just say North-northwest.. The same would work for all the other directions... 'South by Southwest' would be the line between South and Southwest. (South-southwest). If it was the line between the West and the South West, we would call that 'West by Southwest' (West-southwest)	1	4
What does North by North-West mean?	"if you are going north-by-northwest, you are traveling along a direction that is midway between north and northwest.  similarly, if you are going west by northwest, you are traveling along a direction that's midway between west and northwest.  it just gives you a little more ""resolution"" when specifying your direction.. . and yes, it is also a famous hitchcock movie, starring cary grant.. . if a wind is blowing from west to east, that is an easterly wind."	1	4

Other ways, such as diet pills, starvation diets, or malnourishment are ONE HUNDRED PERCENT ways to backfire, and sabotage your health COMPLETELY. To do this, you are risking years of your life. These are all silly diet scams, especially when you are at a young age.. . If you wish to lose weight, always eat healthfully! NEVER go under your daily caloric intake, or your metabolism will suffer. Staying consistent at a reasonable intake is good. Try to exercise a little each day, and stay persistence. If you accidentally overeat, don`t be discouraged! Just stay on track, and expect about a pound a week. Other diets claiming to lose more than 2 pounds per week are 100% SCAMS. These are terrible ways to lose weight, as you may be losing valuable, precious muscle. . . Good Luck! :)	1	4

How do motorcycle remains upright and stable by gyroscopic forces.In detail] ..pls?	They do not stay up by gyroscopic principles.. . If the wheels were heavy enough to behave like gyroscopes you would not be able to turn corners.. . Think about it, if the angular momentum of the wheels was enough to stop them tilting under the weight of you and the bike, then they would also be enough to stop you turning the front wheel.. . Now ask the question properly :-)	1	4
How do motorcycle remains upright and stable by gyroscopic forces.In detail] ..pls?	"The gyroscopic effect is primarily involved in no-hands steering and less with normal travel (see ref.). No-hands stabilization is aided by ""wheel trail"", the front-wheel geometry that allows gravity to steer the front wheel in the direction the bike is tilted. In forward motion, gyroscopic effect also responds to a tilt of the bike by turning the front wheel in the direction of the tilt. This steering repositions the contact patches of the front and rear wheels such that the downforce vector (force due to gravity and centripetal reaction in a turn), projected through the center of mass, intersects the line joining them and thus produces no additional rolling torque on the bike."	1	4
How do motorcycle remains upright and stable by gyroscopic forces.In detail] ..pls?	the tires spinning, become gyroscopes .... if you hold a bicycle tire and rim in your hand and spin it, it has the same effect	1	3

Why isn't there any military bases in the state of Mississippi?	It's usually lobbying by your congressmen that gets the military bases. But maybe the strategic location of the state has some bearing as well. However, a lot of bases have been closed since the cold war ended.  It seems like the military is grouping  their resources into huge complexes rather than having the expense of maintaining a lot of small bases around the country.  I really don't know, it's an opinion.  I'm on the east coast and my state has a lot of bases and people from closed bases will be arriving here shortly, so our military population is going up.	1	3

How can I get rid of a sinus infection without medication?	Without medication will be tough if it is truly an infection, but drinking more clear fluids and a humidifier may help.

How can I get rid of a sinus infection without medication?	Try hot ginger compress. Make a hot ginger tea soak the  towel in it, wring it and put it on the pain to decongest your sinus.

I do mine at night to wake up with a clear sinus.  (You must be careful not to do this alot or use alot of aloe, it may cause stomache problems) When you have pain stay away from salt, sugar and junk food, this contributes to more inflammation. (Mucus feeds on this stuff)  NOTE: never mix herbs or vitamins with over the counter medication or prescribe medication!. Hope to your health!	1	4

""For too long, every ounce of forgiveness I owned was locked away, hidden from view, waiting for me to bestow its precious presence upon some worthy person. Alas, I found most people to be singularly unworthy of my valuable forgiveness, and since they never asked for any, I kept it all for myself. Now, the forgiveness that I hoarded has spouted inside my heart like a crippled seed yielding bitter fruit. . No more! At this moment, my life has taken on new hope and assurance. Of all the world’s population, I am one of the few possessors of the secret to dissipating anger and resentment. I now understand that forgiveness has value only when it is given away. By the simple act of granting forgiveness, I release the demons of the past about which I can do nothing, and I create in myself a new heart, a new beginning.. . I will greet this day with a forgiving spirit. I will forgive even those who do not ask for forgiveness.. . Many are the times when I have seethed in anger at a word or deed thrown into my life by an unthinking or uncaring person. I have wasted valuable hours imagining revenge or confrontation. Now I see the truth revealed about this psychological rock inside my shoe. The rage I nurture is often one-sided, for my offender seldom gives thought to his offense!. . I will now and forevermore silently offer my forgiveness even to those who do not see that they need it. By the act of forgiving, I am no longer consumed by unproductive thoughts. I give up my bitterness. I am content in my soul and effective again with my fellowman.. . I will greet this day with a forgiving spirit. I will forgive those who criticize me unjustly.. . Knowing that slavery in any form is wrong, I also know that the person who lives a life according to the opinion of others is a slave. I am not a slave. I have chosen my counsel. I know the difference between right and wrong. I know what is best for the future of my family, and neither misguided opinion nor unjust criticism will alter my course.. . Those who are critical of my goals and dreams simply do not understand the higher purpose to which I have been called. Therefore, their scorn does not affect my attitude or action. I forgive their lack of vision, and I forge ahead. I now know that criticism is part of the price paid for leaping past mediocrity.. . I will greet this day with a forgiving spirit. I will forgive myself.. . For many years, my greatest enemy has been myself. Every mistake, every miscalculation, every stumble I made has been replayed again and again in my mind. Every broken promise, every day wasted, every goal not reached has compounded the disgust I feel for the lack of achievement in my life. My dismay has developed a paralyzing grip. When I disappoint myself, I respond with inaction and become more disappointed.. . I realize today that it is impossible to fight an enemy living in my head. By forgiving myself, I erase the doubts, fears, and frustration that have kept my past in the present. From this day forward, my history will cease to control my destiny. I have forgiven myself. My life has just begun.. . I will forgive even those who do not ask for forgiveness. I will forgive those who criticize me unjustly. I will forgive myself.. . I will greet this day with a forgiving spirit."""	1	3

Only mature individuals understand the significance of tolerance and how that develops our pysche to transfigure into a more spiritual, emotional true-SELF.. . Good Luck and Prosper...;*!*;...	1	4
How do you stop bad feelings toward the people ?	I don't know the situation so I'll try to answer as best I can.. . Choose to have happy thoughts, happy, happy, happy, happy now say with me. I'm going to be happy with these people, I'm going to love them even though they are worthless, there still important to someone and I'm going to really look for the good in them. They do have something to offer and I'm going to find out what it is. . . All joking aside, we can choose to look at the bad in people or we can choose to find the good. It is all really a choice and sometimes it is very hard, but when I look back on my life and some of the people who I love today, I have to admit had I not of taken the approach I did I would of missed out on some fantastic friendships. Some of my friends really were annoying and drove me crazy, but like I said they are great once I got to know them. Too often people tend to have preconcieved notions about someone or a race and instead of finding out for themselves they just continue on with that un fortunatly they really miss out. I love people and I love to learn from them and we never know when that stranger or annoyance will change your life for the better if you let them. We live in a great world with great people it's just do you look at it that way. I give everyone the benefit of the doubt until they prove me wrong then I go my own way but I'm at peace then.  Take care and choose to look for the GOOD in people it is sooo much better.  Sorry about any typo or incorrect spelling.	1	4

This is also the origin of the children's rhyme ""Ring a ring a roses"". Its words include ""Atishoo, atishoo, we all fall down"".

"Why do we say, ""God bless you"" when someone sneezes?"	"""Roman paganism contributed the traditional ""God bless you"" or Gesundheit (May you have health) offered to one who sneezed.  The old expression was ""Jupiter preserve you"" or ""Jupiter help me""  Its basis was the ancient Indo-European concept of the air-soul or breath-soul (Atman), which might be expelled from the body by a violent rush of air unless prevented by a verbal charm.  Covering the mouth during a yawn arose from the same fear of losing the soul.  Medieval churchmen accepted the superstition, and taught that both sneezing and yawning should be immediately protected by the sign of the cross, because ""Ofttimes a man sneezed, and expired at the moment of sneezing...In like manner it often befell that man yawned, and fell dead."""	1	4

Why do some people refer to the IRS as Uncle Sam?	"I remember hearing a story about meat boxes.. I did a google search and found an interesting web site.. . The following is lifted from the site:. ______________. The prevailing theory is that Uncle Sam was named after Samuel Wilson.. . During the War of 1812, Wilson was in the business of slaughtering and packing meat. He provided large shipments of meat to the US Army, in barrels that were stamped with the initials ""U.S."" Supposedly, someone who saw the ""U.S."" stamp suggested -- perhaps as a joke -- that the initials stood for ""Uncle Sam"" Wilson. The suggestion that the meat shipments came from ""Uncle Sam"" led to the idea that Uncle Sam symbolized the federal government.. . ____________. . I'm sure that is only one of many theories."	1	4
Why do some people refer to the IRS as Uncle Sam?	"It comes from the abbreviation of the United States. (Uncle Sam). It started with the posters of the man with the patriotic top hat saying ""Uncle Sam Wants You"", in the military..Or, the U.S. wants you. We pay the IRS or the Internal Revenue Service, our taxes when not enough has been taken out through the year. Our taxes pay for education, public assistance, subsidized housing, Medicaid and Medicare, salaries for our government officials and many other things we, as citizens have here in our country. So, I wouldn't say Uncle Sam didn't do a dam* thing to get that money. If we didn't have to pay so much for people who never paid into the system, our taxes wouldn't be so high. You can thank the illegal immigrants for a lot of your taxes you pay out. Of course, there are other things that our government spends our tax dollars on that they shouldn't, like the Iraqi War, grants that don't amount anything but gross spending, subsidizing big corporations,etc. Here is what the illegal immigrants cost you:. . Illegal immigration is against the LAW. Legal immigration is OKAY. We would be SAVING tax dollars by sending them back. Here's what they cost us (the USA) ANNUALLY:. . Education: $22.5 billion .

Why do some people refer to the IRS as Uncle Sam?	because he is a sick sick little boy, who is sitgting next to me right now. his name is Sam also, he likes to be touched by people. preferably men. anyway he is sick, just like the IRS. All people named Sam are (from my experience and this lunatic sitting next to me ) sick. The IRS is sick and retarded and money hungry just like all Sams. OOO my .. he is touching me right now. i got to go and throw him out a window. so overall, Sam is a retard (and im guesingg so is Uncle Sam since his name is sam) and because his name is Sam he can be affiliated with the retards at the IRS.	0	2

what happens to bile salts when gallbladder has been removed?	Bile will continue to flow into the duodenum without interruption through the common bile duct.

What is the difference between customer and consumer?	the costomer is the person or company that buys the product/service, while the consumer is the person/company that uses the product/service. for example, if a mom buys dipers, she is the costomer, but the baby is the consumer	1	4
What is the difference between customer and consumer?	Customer is a profile who take decision of purchasing the goods or services,where as a consumer is a prfile who consume or use that goods or services. For Example : Parents are customer for a Kindegarden School where as consumer are the kids who are to be admitted to the school.	1	4
What is the difference between customer and consumer?	a customer is a person who purchase and pay for the product while a consumer is the ultimate user of the product, the consumer may not have paid for the product.	1	4
What is the difference between customer and consumer?	A customer is a human being, who customarily purchases a particular product, or service.. A consumer is merely a person, animal, or even machine that consumes any particular product, or service - without necessarily evincing a liking for it, or purchasing it.. For example, if you buy a tub of ice cream you are a customer. If you give it to child, who polishes it off, the child is a consumer. Similarly, a customer will buy a bundle of straw for a cow to consume. And an automobile will consume any brand of petrol purchased by its owner, who is the real customer.... Thus a customer turns into a consumer, only when he/she consumes the purchase. And a consumer turns customer, when he/she chooses a particular product or service, and buys it ! . ...But the sad part is that even persons who are actively involved in marketing and advertising confuse themselves [and others too !] by misusing both of these terms !	1	4
Why is prostitution wrong?	He wasn't in love--He just loved her.  Just like He loves you and me.  Prostitution is a sin, but no eviler than any other.	1	4
Why is prostitution wrong?	Mary was not a prostitute contrary to popular myth. She was caught in the act of adultery, which does not mean she was accepting money for her services. Your body is worth more than whatever price youwould put on it for sex. Especially if you factor in Aids and other std's. not to mention the women who are killed each day by their pimps or clients.	1	3
Why is prostitution wrong?	She was not a prostitute.  She was so prominent in the life of Jesus, the church has finally admitted this was a lie to take her importance away and tell that she was also an apostle.  The church did not like the fact that a woman had the same status as the other apostles-who were men.. . Her only sin was that she was a woman-not a good fact in the eyes of the church.	0	2
Why is prostitution wrong?	the bible says that our body is our temple	1	3

Why is prostitution wrong?	For one thing we do not know who is the father of the child to many men and sex out side marriage is a kind of prostitution	1	3
Why is prostitution wrong?	"You really think you can be happy being a prostitute? Skill, huh? Skills are things that can be enjoyed without getting payed $400 dollars per night by some crack dealers. You can't enjoy prostitution without the money. You wanna know why prostitution is wrong? Because it lowers you from a human being to an object which people use to please themselves. You pay a prostitute to have sex... You're basically having sex with your money. Both you, and the prostitute feel bad and guilty deep inside, but the prostitute is alright because she got payed, and you're good too, cause you got what you wanted - sex. But you just f'ucked your money.. . I don't know who Jesus was in love with or whatever, but being in love with a prostitute and f'ucking a prostitute are two totally different things. And if Jesus was in love with a prostitute, then from that moment on, the prostitute wasn't a prostitute anymore. Technically you can't be in love with a prostitute. You can only f'uck a prostitute. That's why they're called prostitutes - cause they f'uck a lot. If you're in love with a prostitute, ""f'ucking"" loses its whole meaning, because you don't love the prostitute just so you can f'uck her. Hence, that girl is no longer a prostitute. At least not to you. And in Jesus's case, not to anybody.. Well, good luck."	1	4
Why is prostitution wrong?	Because it is sick!	0	2
Why is prostitution wrong?	"It's not, and we really don't need to hinge our reasons for saying so on the threadbare figure of Jesus.  How about a douche of common sense?. . It's not called the ""oldest profession"" for nothing.  We will never, EVER get rid of prostitution, regardless of how draconian we write our laws.  Furthermore, it truly is a ""victimless crime.""  Both parties are fully willing to engage in the act for their own ends.  If you say ""But the wife at home!"", I say people's private marital issues are none of your damned business, and prostitution doesn't change that.  . . So we may as well write our laws as if we were dealing with reality - a novel approach to be sure.  In Amsterdam, brothels are regulated and taxed.  The prostitutes are checked for STDs and protected by law enforcement.  And the Dutch themselves barely use them - it's only the smarmy, sex-starved, neurotic puritan Americans and their ilk who go to Amsterdam specifically to indulge their ""vice."". . Prohibition doesn't work.  The oldest story in the bible itself is the lesson of the forbidden fruit.  Place something off limits, and instantly it becomes an obsession."	1	3
Why is prostitution wrong?	First of all the kind of love that Jesus had for Mary Magdaline was not that kind of love. Yes, Jesus loved prostitutes, He loves everyone, in fact there is a prostitute in His liniage. Prostitution is wrong 1) because it says so various places in the Bible, 2) the Bible also says that sex outside of marriage is a sin and prostitution occurs outside of marriage, and 3) the Bible says to follow the law of the land and the law of the land (at least in the US) says that prostitution is illegal.	1	3
Why is prostitution wrong?	What a tool! Think about it nerd! Sex should be between a man and a woman for the purposes of procreation and marital bliss. How could you ask such a stupid question? You're a moron, should we pay you to be stupid??? Get a clue chump!!. And Jesus was perfect, He did no such thing. Quit reading trash and read the Bible. You have so much to learn.	0	2
Why is prostitution wrong?	there is nothing in the bible stating she was that prostitute. but as for the question. a womans body is her own .. what she does with it is up to her , as long as she is careful	1	4
Why is prostitution wrong?	What do you think?  Really.. . Are you accepting as fact what is fiction?  Historical records do not bear out what you have perpetrated.. Jesus loved Mary and cast seven devils out of her.  His love was not physical.. . You are close to mortal blasphemy, careful.	0	2
Why is prostitution wrong?	thats a stupid question	0	2
Why is prostitution wrong?	Not A Right livelihood. It create a lot of physical, mental and spiritual problems in your life.	1	3
Why is prostitution wrong?	The only way a man/women would defend prostitution, is because they walk around thinking it is a skill, or a job.    This type of a career leads to much un-happiness and illness.   Any man/women can do this !   Anyone who wants to use the private area with no shame, instead of the brain, can do it.   I don't mean to  judge  your opinion, but this is mine and many other peoples too.  You think prostitution is a talent ??   Ha ha what a laugh.   any women can spread their legs and do it.    But then we fall into the word shame.   Some have no shame.   They think it is great to sell their hind end for little and nothing.   Then do you stop to think what prostitution does to  marriages ?   It cause adulterous break-ups, and in the olden days it causes a lot of syphillis cases.   Many miners and men who traveled away  from home to work, would engage in sex for money only to end up with syphillis and bring it home to his wife and children.   Do you really think this is talent ?    Why can't you use your skills to make money ??    Your  intelligence has got to be better then that.   To use you hind  end as a skill ?      Don't compare  your sinful life to that of Jesus !!  It says in the Holy Bible a once  clean man,  who leaves the house of a prostitute, will walk away, never to be clean again.       So if you think prostitution is a talent and a skill, boy you sure have found a way to defend  yourself.       When any decent man finds out your a prostitute, he will never want you.    What I think of a prostitute is similar to a garbage can.    The men will put debre into your garbage can , leave their stink in your garbage can and then walk away.    Yah , right  , that is really talent and a skill !!!   Figure it out.	1	4
Why is prostitution wrong?	"I wouldn't say it's wrong, if you like it and are comfortable with it why not? I do think however, that putting a price for your body and sexual skill is degrading, because I think it should be done with love, for love not money and lust. Also, I do not enjoy being objectified, when I have sex I am merging with another soul, and I don't wish to merge with just anyone that's feeling horny regardless of whether I really like him. That's the way I feel about it personally, but I don't think it's necessarily ""wrong"" for everyone.. Also, when Mary Magdalene became close to Jesus she stopped prostituting herself so it's not a very good argument in your favour."	1	4
Why is prostitution wrong?	heck, i think prositution should be legalize here in the U.S. so that maybe all these f**king pervs would keep their hands off the children. the main drawn-back is that if it were made nationally legal, these hoes will wanna charge men like hundreds of dollars just for for some trim. this is a man hating country, (like we don't deserve it btw) way too hypocritical and uptight to legalize prostitution. if a hooker is being a hooker cause she wants to be one and no other circumstance is forcing her into prostitution, she's got love here!--just being real!	1	3
Why is prostitution wrong?	Nobody knows for sure that Mary Magdiline was a prostitute, I'm not going to spout off about different theories, but not one person on this entire planet knows exactly what the relationship between jesus and her was, nor whether she was a protitute or not.. Prostitution is looked down on by almost every culture because it is seen as a woman degrading herself, but ask yourself which is worse a man having to pay for it or a woman benefiting from that because she can. prostitutes are looked down upon and slung into the gutter because we still live in a mans world, and any woman who dare speak out against these women is sacrificing everything that women have strived years to rectify. Believe it, the man is the sad party.. And by the way to one of the former answers, there certainly is a skill to sex, you're either good or you're not. And we all know which one we are	0	1

Why is prostitution wrong?	"Jesus was not ""in love"", He loves all people good and bad.  You need to read the Bible and quit going to movies because youare getting pretend and reality confused.  Prostitution is a sin because it is either adultery or fornication, which are both sins.  Sex is for marriage, not for mindless entertainment between people who usually don't even know each others middle name."	1	4
Why is prostitution wrong?	"""Jesus"" was in love with ""Mary Magdiline"", "" you are getting the word lust mixed up with the word love. Most prostitutes have no other job they could do to get drug money or what else they need."	1	3
Why is prostitution wrong?	It is sexually immoral.. . Would you want your daughter doing it?  Your sister?  Your mother?  Your grandmother?. . Our bodies have an assigned eternal value and when we engage in any kind of sexual sin it degrades our bodies and ruins our fellowship that we're supposed to have with God.	1	3
Why is prostitution wrong?	First of all, He wasn't in love with her. He only cared for her soul. He also talked to other sinners: thieves and such. She was a prostitute when he met her, but he changed her. She regreted her sins. That doesn't tell us that prostitution is fine. Rather, it teaches us not to outcast sinners and try to teach them the right ways instead.	1	3
Why is prostitution wrong?	Man, are you mixed up.	0	1
Why is prostitution wrong?	"Right, but wrong. Jesus loved Mary just like he loves you and I and the rest of the world.  It didn't matter to Jesus if you were a prostitute , mass-murderer, or tax collector.  He loves them all the same.  Now Jesus says "" You've heard it said of old that you shall not commit adultery (7th Commandment), but I say to you that if you even look at a woman to lust after her, you have already comitted adultery in your heart.""  So, if you even look with lust you've broken God's law.  So, on Judgment Day God would see you as an adulterer at heart and find you guilty of sinning against His holy nature.  Therefore, He could not let you into Heaven.  He must send you to Hell, otherwise He wouldn't be the Just Judge that He is.  He must punish sin.  Fortunately for us, He is a loving God in that He sent His son, Jesus Christ to die for us on the cross taking the punishment we justly deserve.  If you repenet of your sins and trust Jesus to save you from God's perfect justice, then you will be made right before his holiness.  So forget about sex for money.  If you even think with lust it is a sin against God."	0	2
Why is prostitution wrong?	Not *Wrong* But looked down upon, Weird and kind of gross. . . I can't help but feel sorry for them.	1	3

Why does my congregation complain about lenght of my  90 minute sermons ?	Geez, Rev first of all LENGTH is the correct spelling.  How boring can you get, the average attention span of an adult is 15 minutes, 20 tops without some sort of a break.  If you are preaching for 90 minutes you lost your congregation a long time ago and any point that you were trying to get across has been lost.  I am not sure that I can even recall any section of the bible that stated that Jesus had sermons lasting that long even the sermon on the mount.  I think that you may be possessed by the devil and are really trying to turn your parishoners away from God and his teachings and if this is true you are doing a good job for you already have them complaining, and keep it up and you will have them leaving.  Lighten up, make your point, hit them quick with the facts, let them absorb what you have to say and stop, they will love you for it.  You don't have to go on and on (what I am doing with this dissertation), you can get your point across quickly and effectively, so next Sunday try to shorten your sermon and watch the attention span take hold, watch your congregation come back into the fold and of course watch your collection plate get fuller and fuller for we all know that is the point of your sermons.	1	4
Why does my congregation complain about lenght of my  90 minute sermons ?	you have 202 questions. is this the only way/place to get attention without being run off? looks like sheep, smells like wolf.	0	1

Why does my congregation complain about lenght of my  90 minute sermons ?	as a fellow preacher I can tell you sermons that are long wont be remembered nearly as a good quirky short one. God and the Bible can be made intresting if told in relation to todays events. I try to make 45 minute intresting sermon that tells a story or has intrest. I realize the Bible is not always intresting but I try to bring it to life and keep it short.	1	4
Why does my congregation complain about lenght of my  90 minute sermons ?	Because your not giving them what they need. You need to hold sermons that last 2 hours max. I would feel disapointed when my pastor did short sermons. Give them all more of your knowledge of GOD. Preach On My Brother.	1	3

Why does my congregation complain about lenght of my  90 minute sermons ?	Because you're really hard to look at.	0	2
Why does my congregation complain about lenght of my  90 minute sermons ?	Usually a person can comfortably sit through 45 minutes of preaching and lets say an hour or so if the sermon is very anointed and touching. Generally people tend to lose interest if you extend more than that. Even in the church where I worship we do have this problem. Since I am helping with the church activities and taking care of the administration I have discussed this on many occasions with the Pastor. So our pastor as a rule of the thumb tries to round off the entire sermon in under 1 hour. Usually if he has a lot to cover then he continues the topic the next week and so on. Right now we are studying the mysteries of the bible and it is going on for the last month and a half. It took our pastor the best part of an year to complete the first few chapters of revelation. Since his sermons are with such power and anointing that people usually ask him to continue but like I said he closes it in just under an hour. So I feel your congregation are justified in complaining if the sermon were to extend that long. It is a good practice to stay under 1 hour as you could reserve your energy and put more study into your sermons and it also helps if your sermons are being video graphed as the tapes usually record up to an hour. Try doing this and then I am sure your congregation will ask for more. Hope that helps and May God Bless you and your congregation.	1	4
Why does my congregation complain about lenght of my  90 minute sermons ?	90 minutes? that's ridiculously long. If it takes you that long to get a point across, then maybe the point isn't worth getting across. Everybody loves a clergyman who doesn't waste your time.	1	3

Why does my congregation complain about lenght of my  90 minute sermons ?	A sermon of any kind is boring and sometimes scary.. . The very first time I went to church, the minister scared the absolute s**t out of me and I ran out crying and told my dad I was never going back to church again.. . I have since returned to churches but only for weddings, etc and they still to this day conjure up feelings of uneasiness.. . I guess that is why I am not religious. That and the whole thing just doesn't make sense to me. Oh and because sex is a sin. Well on that premise, I will be going to hell. But I'm having a f**king good time getting there lol.	1	4

Why does my congregation complain about lenght of my  90 minute sermons ?	90 minutes is a very long sermon. Most people do not eat before church, rather thay wait until after and go out as a family. They are probably hungry and that cannot help when you are there for 90 minutes. If I may suggest, cut it down to a main sermon and then have an optional workshop after that for those who wish to stay and hear the word. I am impressed that you take the time to really try and make a difference. I wish you much success!	1	4

Why does my congregation complain about lenght of my  90 minute sermons ?	Because they probably get sleepy, or hungry, or if you are boring, they can't keep their mind on your sermon.

It don't take a rocket scientist to understand the meaning of GOD'S Love!!!	1	3
Why does my congregation complain about lenght of my  90 minute sermons ?	because they can only take so much!. did you know the average person only retains 8% of what we hear each day.

Why does my congregation complain about lenght of my  90 minute sermons ?	I'm not sure, but given your rather colorful questions I'd say you have a sense of humor.

Add some jokes; the soul of wit is brevity, said Shakespeare..  I suggest you read Marshal McLuhan:  . Customers who searched for marshal McLuhan ultimately chose:  . 1.

Why does my congregation complain about lenght of my  90 minute sermons ?	A 90 minute sermon can be elongated and become boring. You will find that you often lose them after 30 minutes because they are expecting another hour. Try to shorten it to an hour or 45 min. Get to the point, but make sure there is time to explain everything you need to in order to bring across your point.	1	4

On the most fundamental level, why is killing other humans bad?	"Okay, pretending I am an objective non-human observer, I still say there is no reason to indiscrimately slaughter any life form.   Killing humans is as bad as, say, killing dolphins, or cats, or snakes.  Action without purpose is evil, I can't remember who said that, but as objectively as I can get, it seems to be a fundamental truth.. . Now, as an objective non-human observer watching humans kill humans, well, I suppose that's just the nature of the animal, none of my business.. . Now, I am human and i think killing another person for no other reason other than they THINK differently or LOOK different, or (the most favoured excuse today) they have something we want is pitiable for a species that likes to pretend it is evolving to a ""higher being""."	1	3
On the most fundamental level, why is killing other humans bad?	According to Heidegger people, compared to things are open, which means they are not finished or done being what they should, Things instead can not be more than what they already are (dogs and rocks can be no more than dogs and rocks) Persons are humans but also protects, you can die being more than what you were at the time you were born.. So if you kill a human, you destroy that possibility.	1	3
On the most fundamental level, why is killing other humans bad?	Instinct I suppose. A natural group of mammals move together, protecting the herd, and keeping forces both external and internal from hurting that group. . . Humans, at the basic level, want to survive just like all the other animals. So we keep our group alive by not killing it off internally.. . For any mammal, even humans, to kill another of our own species is detrimental because we then can not mate with that dead person and produce offspring.	1	4
On the most fundamental level, why is killing other humans bad?	Becuase it lessens the evolutionary well-being of humanity when you start taking out members of the species.	1	3
On the most fundamental level, why is killing other humans bad?	On the most fundamental level destroying anything is neither good nor bad. But as humans we have a problem dealing with this fundamental level because we do not live in a vacuum. There is Ethics, morality, religion, culture and human feelings to consider when the killing of other humans comes to mind.  From a human point of view, taking a human being’s life, in the context of civilization, is an aberrant irrational, dehumanized, sick, perverted, immoral and criminal act. Outside of his civilized environment, the human animal does not need justification to kill.	1	4

On the most fundamental level, why is killing other humans bad?	because then we would become extinct ?	1	3
On the most fundamental level, why is killing other humans bad?	Biologically, it is bad for the species to reduce it in number.   Most species (not all, of course) refrain from killing their own for those biological/genetic reasons.	1	4
On the most fundamental level, why is killing other humans bad?	It's not always. I think it's right to take one life to save many.. . But killing for any other reason is wrong because everyone should be allowed to live. Why should everyone be allowed to live? I can't explain that; it's one of the axioms of human society.	1	3
On the most fundamental level, why is killing other humans bad?	life is precious and shouldn't be taken away for no reason	1	3

On the most fundamental level, why is killing other humans bad?	because we don't want this world to become a jungle where the strongest live and the weakest die.. give the weak another chance u were a weak once if not u will be once....... trust me....	0	2
On the most fundamental level, why is killing other humans bad?	On a fundamental level humans killing other humans is genocide -- the killing of like beings.. . It is termination of an entity equal to yourself causing that person to cease existence, stop growing, learning, loving, and contributing to society.. . Similarly, there are occasions where killing other humans is justified at a fundamental level -- such as in defense of person being attacked unjustly or one's country.	1	4
On the most fundamental level, why is killing other humans bad?	At the most fundamental level, killing anything is bad because it deprives the killed from their opportunity to exist.. . At the human to human level, because humans have so much capability, killing another human eliminates the possibility of that human interacting with the world again.  Each human has great potential and we - as a species - have optimism and hope that each human will interact well with the world and the other humans in a society.  . . It is that hope that makes killing other humans bad.  We hope that the other human could be a good person - a productive, loving member of our society.  The fear of preventing that human from reaching their potential results in our feeling bad when that human is killed.. . The reality, unfortunately, is that not all humans consider other humans worthy of respect and co-existance.  When that happens, we - as a society - have to band together and do what is necessary.  In most cases, that means remove the freedom of the offending human to interact in society (e.g. prison).  But sometimes split-second decisions have to be made to save another life (e.g. hostage situation) or a repeat offender will never learn through incarceration that hurting others is bad, so they have to be killed (e.g. capital punishment).. . In the global setting, some leaders believe that they lead through force.  Their followers are willing (or enticed) into killing others in order to extend their idea of society onto other societies by force.  The result is either genocide (if the victims don't resist) or war (if the victims resist and become opponents).  . . Capital punisment is bad, but unchecked murder is worse.. War is bad, but genocide is worse.	1	4
On the most fundamental level, why is killing other humans bad?	You are changing the course of the future.  The person you killed could've discovered a cure for Aids or might have had a future child who had a child that would bring peace to the middle east, and so on...	1	4

How and Why did the Roman Empire Fell Apart?	roman empire fell due to anarchy. all nations will eventually fall.	1	4
How and Why did the Roman Empire Fell Apart?	"In short, because they became too comfortable and lazy.  Let their guard down just like we are doing here in the U.S. and let their society rot from inside out.  A good example is that during the rise of the empire Rome was always increasing areas money, wealth, importation of all sorts of animals, goods, and other oddities. This all kept the population moving ahead.   Most folks don't realize that while the Roman empire lasted a very long time, it was only in the ""late days"" that the gladiators appeared.  This was a symptom of the decay of their society because by that time they felt that they had ""done it all and seen it all"" and had to ""invent"" more gore, violence, and such to entertain themselves.  Sort of a ""Jerry Springer Show"" for the Romans!  hahaha    Some very important correlation between the end times for the Romans, and what we as Americans are doing today with economy, education, trade, immigration, and politics.  The more you read on this the more it will make sense.   A saw a comment posted that ""all civilizations eventually fall"" and they are truly right .  Our's is not immune to this and is on the decline already.  My favorite quote on History is the one that says, ""People who fail to learn from History are Doomed to Repeat It"". No truer words were ever spoken.  :-)"	1	4
How and Why did the Roman Empire Fell Apart?	Dang man! why not just ask us to explain quantum mechanics in 25 words or less, but be specific.  Go to the library.   Will Durant's book is excellent, so is Rise and Fall of the Roman Empire, so is Those About to Die.    Too many factors came together to be explained in this little space.	1	4

why precisely is foreign food considered ethnic?	"Actually, German, French, Italian, Polish...they're all considered to be ""ethnic"" cusine and from Europe. It's considereded ""ethnic"" in the U.S. because it is traditionally from another region & not something commonly served in a U.S. household. It can't be called ""foreign"" because that would be politically incorrect.........I guess. Whatever the reason, this country wouldn't be what it is today if it weren't for our wonderful blend of so many ethnic foods!"	1	4
why precisely is foreign food considered ethnic?	"No, food that is not ""fusion"" is all considered ""ethnic."" All American food is considered fusion or eclectic. For example, you take an Italian Pizza and add Mexican Guacamole now it's ecectic fusion. Does that make sense?"	1	4
why precisely is foreign food considered ethnic?	"Because we don't eat it here on a regularly or normaly.  Really, there is actually no such thing as American food since it all came from somewhere else.  But here, they ""Americanized"" it in some way.  When you eat Chinese food, you're not eating the same thing that they eat in China.  What they really eat over there we most likely will think is gross, so they changed it in some ways for us to eat it and like it.  Hope ya get that, lol."	1	3

How do U end a bad rep.?	The worst thing you can do is live your life worrying about what people are going to say.. . Just move forward, live your life how you want to live.

How do U end a bad rep.?	I was young and dumb when I was 18. Anyway there are several things that can speed up the healing. One thing that most people have a hard time accepting is that you can choose your friends. Your rep is greatly determined by the friends that you have close to you.	1	4

How do U end a bad rep.?	O.K. good news is your 18 now and all your past actions can be left behind and considered childish mischief. Just think now you can go away to college or just move and you'll never see these people agagin . If you can't next time you see the boys and they snicker or something just tell them to get lost	1	4
How do U end a bad rep.?	First you have to own what you have done, because you can't get that time back, go get some help with this situation - consoling. Second, you have to gather yourself around new people who don't know anything about this. If worst come to worst - move away from the situation and start your life over, by going to college in another town or state, and maybe share your experience with younger girls to show them that they don't have to do what you have done to fit in. I sense that you realized that you made a mistake, not your first and I know not your last, but it's a part of growing.	1	4
How do U end a bad rep.?	YIKES!!   Thats pretty hard core, just have to wait it out or move. Do other things, not ho like, and people will start noticing that and eventually it will go away.

Who got the sloppy seconds and thirds?. Basically they just screwed their guy friend in my opinnion.. Gross	1	3

If you are trying to see Sweden after the 31st of March 2007, you should take a train to Basle, then take the CityNightLine night train to Copenhagen and then take the X2 to Stockholm.

why not legalize, and tax prostitution?	If the goberment legalize the prostitution, they will reduce or increase their quarrels?. . ................. :D	1	4
why not legalize, and tax prostitution?	Its legal in Amsterdam and elsewhere in Europe, why not here.. Oh yeah, and the incidence of STDs is fairly low, as the prostitutes are tested regularly and they always use condoms.. http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2002815117_amsterdam19.html?syndication=rss. And while their at it, lets get marijuana on the legalization fast track too!	0	2
why not legalize, and tax prostitution?	Let's see. It would decrease crime, increase public revenue, and help stem the spread of STDs.. . People would have to exercise some self-control, though. And an ancient book of myths says it's wrong.. . I think we all know how this one turns out.. . Frustrating, isn't it?	1	3
why not legalize, and tax prostitution?	Legalize it. Create certain rules as to where, when and who can use and offer it. Tax it like any other business. Make it accountable, as other acctivities are. And don´t let self-righteousness rule. That´s why I think Amendment XVIII should be repealed.	1	4
why not legalize, and tax prostitution?	They do in Nevada.  However, no, it would not bring down the rape rate.  I also don't support the government becoming a pimp.  We have gone downhill enough with our morals already.  It also would spread HIV, no matter how much you test.  I really don't want to raise my kids in a society where prostitution is acceptable, either.	1	4
why not legalize, and tax prostitution?	In Nevada, or parts of it, prositiution is legal.  And, there are taxes on it, there are laws governing it, and all that jazz.. . While, legalizing prostitution everywhere does have benefits of tax income, health controls, and some public oversight there are still negatives.. . First, it makes it easier to get prostitutes.  This may seem like an ok thing but it puts forth an easier means for people to cheat.  Have mass prostitution illegal does put some protections in place to protect people from themsleves, drunk decisions, and the people they care about. Then there is also the culture around prostitution.  It is not one of self esteem and is very hard for the girls involved.  To promote that culture, attitude, and lifestyle on women is really damaging in many ways.	1	4
why not legalize, and tax prostitution?	It would not bring down the rate of rape, as rape is all about power.	0	2
why not legalize, and tax prostitution?	There are several countries that DO do this.. .

why not legalize, and tax prostitution?	Two consenting adults. Legalize it its the oldest profession. Why waste time and money enforcing something that is not enforceable?

why not legalize, and tax prostitution?	prostitution will always be here and so will religious nuts who think it is the worst thing in the world. The people who oppose it the most are the hypocrit johns and religioooous leaders who use protitutes themselves. Married women usually also hate prostitutes but should be thankful to them for providing a safe place for their husbnads to cheat rather than having a girlfriend. The cops act like when they arrest hookers they are catching serial killers! The streetwalkers now are addicts doing it for $5.00 which is so sad since if they cleaned up and got a car they could get $200 for the same thing.	0	2
why not legalize, and tax prostitution?	I would rather not have prostitutes where I live, but that's just me.  Keep it legal in places, not everywhere.	1	3
why not legalize, and tax prostitution?	"Listen to Me, my son! I know what I am saying; LISTEN! Watch yourself lest you you be indiscreet and betray some vital information. For the lips of a prostitute are sweet as honey, and smooth flattery is her stock in trade. But afterwards only a bitter conscience is left to you, sharp as a double-edged sword. She leads you down to death and hell. For she does not know the path to life. She staggers down a crooked trail, and doesn't even realize where it leads.. Young men, listen to Me, and never forget what I'm about to say: RUN FROM HER! DON'T GO NEAR HER HOUSE, lest you fall to her temptation and lose your honor, and give the remainder of your life to the cruel and merciless; lest strangers obtain your wealth, and you become a slave to foreigners. Lest afterwards you groan in anguish and shame, when syphilis consumes your body, and you say,"" Oh, if only I would have listened! If only I had not demanded my own way! Oh, why wouldn't I take advice? Why was I so stupid? For now I must face public disgrace."" . Drink water from your own well, my son-- be faithful and true to your wife. Why should you beget children with women of the street? Why share children with those outside your home? Let your manhood be a blessing; rejoice in the wife of your youth. Let her charms and tender embrace satisfy you. Let her love alone fill you with delight. Why delight yourself with prostitutes, embracing what isn't yours? FOR GOD IS CLOSELY WATCHING YOU, and He weighs carefully everything you do."	0	2
why not legalize, and tax prostitution?	Prostitution in Nevada, is legal only in certain areas.  The simple street walker isn't legal.  As evidence on COPS... Our country was founded by puritans, some of those same isms. for lack of a better term, still stand to this day.  Where as countries like Canada, and a slew of others, do allow prostitution, it's much differant than what we have here.  There are strict guidelines that they must follow, regarding health check ups and what not.  The question of taxing the girls services... Service charge...(lol)  wouldn't amount to a lot.  It's really not going to change anything really.	1	4

Some criminals beleive that they are creating some sort of masterpeice by a robbery, serial murder or other crime.

"A white marble tomb built in 1631-48 in Agra, seat of the Mugal Empire, by Shah Jehan for his wife, Arjuman Banu Begum, the monument sums up many of the formal themes that have played through Islamic architecture. Its refined elegance is a conspicuous contrast both to the Hindu architecture of pre-Islamic India, with its thick walls, corbeled arches, and heavy lintels, and to the Indo-Islamic styles, in which Hindu elements are combined with an eclectic assortment of motifs from Persian and Turkish sources."". . —Marvin Trachtenberg and Isabelle Hyman. Architecture: from Prehistory to Post-Modernism. p223. . . ""The Mausoleum of the Taj Mahal at Agra stands in a formally laid-out walled garden entered through a pavilion on the main axis. The tomb, raised on a terrace and first seen reflected in the central canal, is entirely sheathed in marble, but the mosque and counter-mosque on the transverse axis are built in red sandstone. The four minarets, set symmetrically about the tomb, are scaled down to heighten the effect of the dominant, slightly bulbous dome. The mosques, built only to balance the composition are set sufficiently far away to do no more than frame the mausoleum. In essence, the whole riverside platform is a mosque courtyard with a tomb at its centre. The great entrance gate with its domed central chamber, set at the end of the long watercourse, would in any other setting be monumental in its own right."". . ""The interior of the building is dimly lit through pierced marble lattices and contains a virtuoso display of carved marble. Externally the building gains an ethereal quality from its marble facings, which respond with extraordinary subtlety to changing light and weather."""	1	4

what is taj mahal?	"Agra, once the capital of the Mughal Empire during the 16th and early 18th centuries, is one and a half hours by express train from New Delhi. Tourists from all over the world visit Agra not to see the ruins of the red sandstone fortress built by the Mughal emperors but to make a pilgrimage to Taj Mahal, India’s most famous architectural wonder, in a land where magnificent temples and edificies abound to remind visitors about the rich civilization of a country that is slowly but surely lifting itself into an industrialized society. . The postcard picture of Taj Mahal does not adequately convey the legend, the poetry and the romance that shroud what Rabindranath Tagore calls ""a teardrop on the cheek of time"". Taj Mahal means ""Crown Palace"" and is in fact the most well preserved and architecturally beautiful tomb in the world. It is best described by the English poet, Sir Edwin Arnold, as ""Not a piece of architecture, as other buildings are, but the proud passions of an emperor’s love wrought in living stones."" It is a celebration of woman built in marble and that’s the way to appreciate it. . . . Taj Mahal stands on the bank of River Yamuna, which otherwise serves as a wide moat defending the Great Red Fort of Agra, the center of the Mughal emperors until they moved their capital to Delhi in 1637. It was built by the fifth Mughal emperor, Shah Jahan in 1631 in memory of his second wife, Mumtaz Mahal, a Muslim Persian princess. She died while accompanying her husband in Burhanpur in a campaign to crush a rebellion after giving birth to their 14th child. The death so crushed the emperor that all his hair and beard were said to have grown snow white in a few months. . . . When Mumtaz Mahal was still alive, she extracted four promises from the emperor: first, that he build the Taj; second, that he should marry again; third, that he be kind to their children; and fourth, that he visit the tomb on her death anniversary. He kept the first and second promises. Construction began in 1631 and was completed in 22 years. Twenty thousand people were deployed to work on it. The material was brought in from all over India and central Asia and it took a fleet of 1000 elephants to transport it to the site. It was designed by the Iranian architect Ustad Isa and it is best appreciated when the architecture and its adornments are linked to the passion that inspired it. It is a ""symbol of eternal love"".. . . The Taj rises on a high red sandstone base topped by a huge white marble terrace on which rests the famous dome flanked by four tapering minarets. Within the dome lies the jewel-inlaid cenotaph of the queen. So exquisite is the workmanship that the Taj has been described as ""having been designed by giants and finished by jewellers"". The only asymmetrical object in the Taj is the casket of the emperor which was built beside the queen’s as an afterthought. The emperor was deposed by his son and imprisoned in the Great Red Fort for eight years but was buried in the Taj. During his imprisonment, he had a view of the Taj. . . . As a tribute to a beautiful woman and as a monument for enduring love, the Taj reveals its subtleties when one visits it without being in a hurry. The rectangular base of Taj is in itself symbolic of the different sides from which to view a beautiful woman. The main gate is like a veil to a woman’s face which should be lifted delicately, gently and without haste on the wedding night. In indian tradition the veil is lifted gently to reveal the beauty of the bride. As one stands inside the main gate of Taj, his eyes are directed to an arch which frames the Taj. . . . The dome is made of white marble, but the tomb is set against the plain across the river and it is this background that works its magic of colours that, through their reflection, change the view of the Taj. The colours change at different hours of the day and during different seasons. Like a jewel, the Taj"	1	4

How to reduce crime and violence?	Until parents quit abdicating their responsibilities to schools and return to raising their children crime will probably continue to escalate. Punishment for crimes is not much of a deterrent because no one commits a crime with the idea they'll be caught. Public hangings in the 1800's offered public entertainment but didn't do a lot to prevent crime. Punishment of the adult offender in today's society doesn't prevent crime it just takes away the opportunity for the person to repeat his or her crime..  To change society you have to start with children at an age when you can mold values, a concept the Germans figured out in WWII, then as they become adults they carry these same values with them.	1	4
How to reduce crime and violence?	Tougher penalties for crimes, make prison an actual punishment for committing crimes, and go back to the days of teaching children right from wrong and disciplining them when they do wrong.	1	3
How to reduce crime and violence?	I think that instead of the death penalty, we should put people who commit certain crimes on a national list of people it's ok to kill and not be prosecuted.	0	2
How to reduce crime and violence?	God should be introduced first. Respect for one's self and for others must be taught in the home at the earliest age. It must be a comfortable part of everyone's environment and as easy as the need for air, food and shelter. Adequate job training and JOBS along with education are secondary to the home-based knowledge that is presented at an early age. When no one has to defend themselves because of one thing or another, there will be no need for crime and violence.	1	4
How to reduce crime and violence?	in my point of view the best way to reduce violence is not to answer violence with violence.if you will treat someone bad when you are getting bad,this is not the right solution to it.PEACE IS THE BEST!	1	3

How to reduce crime and violence?	PUBLIC EXECUTION'S AND NO MORE PRISONER RIGHTS IN JAILS.YOU BREAK THE LAW YOU DO HARD TIME LIKE THE CHAIN GANGS BACK IN THE 40s. most jails are like country clubs and when a person gets out they are not scared to go back so they just go back to breaking the law.	1	3

What are some common causes of my cat's eye to be watery and drip clear fluid?	Is it red? Is it swollen? My cat was playing with another cat and got an infection...

What are some common causes of my cat's eye to be watery and drip clear fluid?	allergies or an infection.... . has he had any fights? once my uncle's cat's kitten fought with another kitten and it was very serious...turns out that the other kitten used it claws to scratch the other's eyes and that is why the other had one eye blind...looks horrible. . sometimes your cat can fight with another cat if it is not agreeing with it so thatz why don't get two adult cats because they will sometimes not agree with each other and fight. if your cats eyes are still watery and drip clear fluid you will need to consult a vet because this sounds serious. probraly a vet can prescribe medicine for the eye or treat it professionally because if you handle this yourself and try to fix it you may make it even worse or possibly make your cat blind like my uncle's kitten. meanwhile clean the area around it and try not to touch it too much.	1	4

How Do I Get Rid Of Pink Eye Quick At Home?	Pink eye, or conjunctivitis, is an inflammation of the eye.  It is usually caused by touching the eyes with dirty fingers, but can also be caused by wearing contaminated eye makeup, or even from getting something blown by the wind into your eyes.  I work in a nursing home.  This kind of infection is quite common there, because the elderly are not careful about where they put their fingers and then are not good about washing their hands before touching t heir eyes.  I have treated many following doctor's orders by carefully applying Johnson & Johnson Baby shampoo to the eyelid with a sterile q tip 2 or 3 times a day.  The baby shampoo cleans the eye without irritating the eye lining.  You can also visit with your doctor about getting antibiotic eye drops to apply to your eyes.. Be very careful about rubbing or wiping your eyes with your fingers.  Pink eye is quite contagious. Keep your pillowcase clean by changing it often while your eyes are infected.  Always wipe from the inner corner of your eyes (next to your nose) outward.  Never wipe your eyes inward.  If you use a tissue, wipe with it once then discard it.  Do not reuse it.. If your eyes do not clear up in a day or so, see a doctor.	1	4

Why are some Americans so prudish when it comes to sex?	"It's like we're of two minds when it comes to sex.  On the one hand, we see nudity and the human form as ""dirty"" and equate it with sex, worry that teaching our kids sex ed will corrupt them, and get offended when women breastfeed (however discreetly) in public.  On the other hand, we have a more than thriving porn industry and more sex offenders than we can handle.  I think if we had a more matter-of-fact mindset about human sexuality and didn't twist it into something nasty, then there would less of the nastiness."	1	4

Why are some Americans so prudish when it comes to sex?	It's not a question of being prudish, it's a question of having a conscious and morals. Being loose and and promiscuous shows a great lack of morals and low self esteem. We should treat are bodies with respect and then others will respect us. Sex is not a game as some people use it for. The majority of people don't know the difference between love and lust, they need to take a deep look at why they are so promiscuous and then they would find the answer as to why some people are prudish, they have high self esteem and great love of themselves. It would n't hurt for more people to be prudish and stop giving in to lust, might just make the world a better place to live in, people might just start caring about each other once again and stop just discarding each other like trash after they have got what they want and used them up. Think about it!!	1	4

Why do I fall asleep after I eat and how can I prevent that?	Scientific reason is after eating more blood moves towards your stomach area which is required for digestion.This results in lesser blood flow towards brain and you feel dizziness.It is more in case of smokers.If you are suffering from gastric problem then also you get the same symptoms.. Try to take less quantity at a time.Eat slowly without gulping.	1	4
Why do I fall asleep after I eat and how can I prevent that?	it's natural to fall asleep immediately after eating a large meal because you become relaxed.  avoid turkey or pork, because they have something in them to make people fall asleep quickly.	1	3
Why do I fall asleep after I eat and how can I prevent that?	Whenever people get tired after eating it is because their metabolism is either working overtime trying to digest a large meal or they've gone long periods without eating. I would recommend eating smaller meals spread throughout your day. Instead of 3 large meals, such as breakfast, lunch and dinner, you may consider a schedule of 5-6 smaller meals spread out evenly. The point is you want to regulate your metabolism so that it is steady and not climbing any peaks or taking any nosedives. If there is ever a point when you actually feel a sensation of hunger, then you have waited too long since your last meal.	1	4

Why do I fall asleep after I eat and how can I prevent that?	"My father is a doctor (cancer speciallist) and says, . ""Feeling sleepy after taking a meal is natural because the blood circulations turn to your stomach for proper digestion and in the brain the blood circulation becomes a bit less thats why when you do such things that requires brain, i mean deep thinking etc. you feel sleepy. Avoiding deep thinking & getting relaxed after your meal is the proper solution to your problem."""	1	4
Why do I fall asleep after I eat and how can I prevent that?	It sounds like your blood sugar level is playing games with you.If this is the case,then you need to change your diet and eating habbits.You need to avoid potatoes and bread products.You also need to eat small portions during meals and have snacks between the meals.For your meals,eat baked,broiled or steamed meat and avoid frying foods,eat green leafy vegtables or carrots uncooked or steamed.If you desire,have a light desert such as a bowl of jello or a small portion of bannana pudding or cobbler.As for your in between snacks,have something like a glass of milk and a bag of peanuts,a beef jerky stick,fruit or anything that is high in protein.Just remember high protein foods,no sugar or minimum sugar and avoid anything that contains startch(this automatically turns to sugar).If you desire something sweet,try eating natural fruit such as a sweet apple,peach,plum,an orange,or berries.Fruits make their own sweetness which will not raise or lower your blood sugar level.If this diet does not improve your problems or you start experiencing any other symptoms such as dizziness or you feel like you are going to faint then I would suggest seeing a doctor as soon as possible because it could be more serious than correcting your diet.I use to pass out after eating and then it got worse,I would black out while driving and luckily someone else was with me each time.I saw my doctor and he changed my diet and it has been over 8 years since I have had a problem ater changes.. .

how can i strengthen my eyes?	sit upright with your shoulders relaxed. keep your head still as you look up and down 5 times. look to the right and left 5 times. circle your eyes clockwise 5 times, then reverse.. you can exercise your eye muscles everyday to prevent eyestrain and protect your vision.	1	4

how can i strengthen my eyes?	carrots are very good for your eyes!	1	3
how can i strengthen my eyes?	carrots are good for eyes	1	3
how can i strengthen my eyes?	Eat carrots! It's true. Carrots contain the chemical beta-carotene, which is good for your eyesight. The U.S. Army knows about it too; they feed their snipers lots and lots of carrots. Sometimes, some of them even get an orange tinge in their skin from eating so much!	1	3
how can i strengthen my eyes?	The thing that works the best to help strengthen your eyes is reading. The more you use your eyes to track (follow) the lines of words, the better the muscle strength. If you mean strengthen them so you don't need glasses, that isn't really possible, you can't force your eyes to work better than they do. If you keep trying you will only weaken them more in the long run (meaning: need a stronger prescription pair of glasses).	1	4
how can i strengthen my eyes?	You probably need glasses; even though eating carrots is good for eyesight some eye doctors say wearing glasses for a while help to strengthen the eyes. But, if your eyesight has been weak for a while you may have to wear glasses permanently. The best thing to do along with eating carrots is to have your eyes checked to be on the safe side.	0	2

And perhaps you are a little mixed up with regard to magic itself.  What YOU imagine when you think of ""magic"" may be something entirely different to a wiccan's definition of magic.  Are you sure you understand exactly what the wiccan's are referring to when they mention magic?  Perhaps not.. It is to your credit that you call a spade a spade when you feel you have seen a spade.

Why do Wiccans believe that they have magical powers when they don't ever produce any magic?	Magick, like energy can not be produced, but is already in everything. . . Magick  is a fire creating heat, trees coming back to life after a long cold winter, food turning into energy, a new life in a womb, the warm fuzzy feelings we get when we see someone who is loved. . . The practice of magick is to gather the energy already present in the world around us, and direct it towards a desired goal. Magick is not instantaneous either, it takes time, patience and practice. Magick is a tool to help, You can do all the spells you want for employment, but if you dont get off the couch and look for a job, the you wont find one. It is much like prayer, you may not see the results, but you can feel it working, and if nothing else helps have a positive frame of mind, which always helps.	1	4

how is lava made?	Under high pressure deep inside the Earth, temperatures rise above the melting point of rock, and it turns into magma.  When it pushes through to the Earth's surface in a volcano, it becomes lava.	1	4

how is lava made?	the earth has a molten core, this is magma or lava and it comes out from volcanos.. i guess that if you want to make some you have to achieve temperatures of thousands of dregrees to get it done .. God bless, . gabe	1	3
how is lava made?	Lava is molten rock expelled by a volcano during an eruption. Magma is molten rock below the earth's surface. Lava, when first exuded from a volcanic vent, is a liquid at temperatures from 700 °C to 1,200 °C (1,300 °F to 2,200 °F). Although lava is quite viscous, about 100,000 times the viscosity of water, it can flow great distances before cooling and solidifying.	1	4

Lava, when first exuded from a volcanic vent, is a liquid at temperatures from 700 °C to 1,200 °C (1,300 °F to 2,200 °F). Although lava is quite viscous, about 100,000 times the viscosity of water, it can flow great distances before cooling and solidifying.. . Lava solidifies to form igneous rock. The term ""lava flow"" refers to the hardened formation, whereas the one still having molten rock associated, is called an ""active lava flow"". The word 'lava' comes from Italian, and is probably derived from the Latin word labes which means a fall, slide, or sinking in. The first use in connection with extruded magma was apparently in a short account written by Francesco Serao [1] on the eruption of Vesuvius between May 14 and June 4, 1737. Serao described ""a flow of fiery lava"" as an analogy to the flow of water and mud down the flanks of the volcano following heavy rain.. . Lava composition. In general, a lava's composition determines its behavior more than the temperature of its eruption. Igneous rocks, which form lava flows when erupted, can be classified into three chemical types; felsic, intermediate, and mafic. These classes are primarily chemical; however, the chemistry of a lava also tends to correlate with the magma temperature, its viscosity and its mode of eruption.. . Felsic lavas such as rhyolite and dacite are often associated with strombolian eruptions, typically form lava domes and sheeted flows, and are associated with pyroclastic surge deposits and tuffs. Felsic lavas are extremely viscous. This is caused primarily by the chemistry of the magma, which is high in silica, aluminium, potassium, sodium, and calcium, forming a polymerized liquid rich in feldspar and quartz, which is thus much more sticky than other magma types. Felsic magmas can erupt at temperatures as low as 650 to 750 degrees Celsius, although they can be hotter.. . Intermediate lavas are lower in aluminium and silica, and usually somewhat richer in magnesium and iron. Intermediate lavas form andesite domes and sheeted flows, are usually associated with strombolian eruptions, and form composite volcanoes. Poorer in aluminium and silica than felsic lavas, and also hotter (in the range of 750 to 950 degrees Celsius), they tend to be less viscous. Greater temperatures tend to destroy polymerized bonds within the magma, promoting more fluid behaviour and also a greater tendency to form phenocrysts. Higher iron and magnesium tends to manifest as a darker groundmass, and also occasionally amphibole or pyroxene phenocrysts.. . Mafic or basaltic lavas are typified by their high ferromagnesian content, and generally erupt at temperatures in excess of 950 degrees Celsius. Basaltic magma is high in iron and magnesium, and has relatively lower aluminium and silica, which taken together reduces the degree of polymerization within the melt. Due to the higher temperatures, viscosities can be relatively low, although still thousands of times more viscous than water. The low degree of polymerization and high temperature favors chemical diffusion, so it is common to see large, well-formed phenocrysts within mafic lavas. Basalt volcanoes tend to form shield volcanoes, as the fluid magma tends to form thin, widely distributed flows.. . Ultramafic lavas such as komatiite and high-magnesian magmas which form boninite take the composition and temperatures of eruptions to the extreme. Komatiites contain over 18% magnesium oxide, and are thought to have erupted at temperatures of 1600 °C. At this temperature there is no polymerization of the mineral compounds, creating a highly mobile liquid with viscosity as low as that of water. Most if not all ultramafic lavas are no younger than the Proterozoic, with a few ultramafic magmas known from the Phanerozoic. No modern komatiite lavas are known, as the Earth's mantle h"	1	4

how is lava made?	Lava is the expression of the earth's molten rock or magma, generally seeping out of a vent in the earth's surface, perhaps from an active volcano.  It is a liquid, and so flows downhill, cooling as it does very rapidly.  If it doesn't come out of the ground, it might cool more slowly under the capstone, and turn into a crystalline granite or even a gemstone.	1	4

"yes...it has something to do with looks...you say you would never see a cute guy with an over weight women. but same vise versa...why are you looking for that cute guy,go look for the over weight one that is funny and tells jokes...  nobody really understands it's not that the skinny girl gets the worm...it's just a matter of fact that you see over weight people and first thing you think is why don't they do something about it... why don't they take care of themselves. I'ts a health issue.....yes i am skinny ...very skinny...but i was a big girl once and all my family are big girls....it's unhealthy and that's my only reason for thinking about it. i want my mom to be around for a long time. i don't want her to die from something that she could have prevented. and plus if they don't look at you ...they are just not interested.... it would be sad to think that everyone that look at you should want to be with you....maybe that guy likes to be with a girl who doesn't sit and worry herself with problems about other people. and if girls stay with guys no matter how they treat them...guys can do it too. some guys like that bytchy type...or the temptress, or a girl who makes sure she looks good and take care of herself.  what ever he likes he's going for it... I am sure if you had a choice you would go for the 6'3'  205lb nice looking guy with muscles  than the 5'6""inch 350lb guy that tells jokes and read the t.v.guide.  There are plenty of guys that like heavier women and vise versa...if it's that much of a concern...just wear a T-shirt or a sign on your head saying  ""i am a smart and funny girl... i like walks in the parks, and dancing. .

why does it seem that no matter how hard you try.....?	The reason why you can't get this person to notice you is just one of the many things you have written about below your main question. I an still in your shoes I'm not too heavy. But  form passed experience  men look at your body first and then if they like what they see they make their move, those kind of guys don't really want any thing more than a one night stand and then they never call or see you again, if you would pursue this guy I know that he will react in the matter I have just described. I'd be very careful of guys who are way to friendly they re only after one thing and I know that you know this too. Or the man is just not interested in you no matter how hard you try, he will never see you in the way you want him to. Move on there other men out there that would like you very much just keep looking and when you leats expect it that is when you will find your true love.	1	4
why does it seem that no matter how hard you try.....?	I know exacty what your saying and it is so sad that people are like that. Some men are so blind and don't know their left hand from the right.

I believe a man should look deeper into a woman, I mean, like their personality should mean something to them, besides the looks. . . Its too bad a lot of guys are like that. Love is Blind. . . Good Luck and I believe you will find the right man some day. It might take you awhile but he's out there looking for you right now. Stay positive and be proud of yourself.	1	4

I hope this helps you.	1	4
why does it seem that no matter how hard you try.....?	I asked myself that question a millions of times but I realized if a man wants me because of my looks and not how I feel or of my intellegents then I don't need him at all cause you can find a good man out there who loves you more than your looks and who will appreciate your goodness and love you unconditionally, cause there are girls out there who may look cute but are really ugly on the inside, and then the guy will get his feelings hurt and then he will realize that beauty is only skin deep, but it takes guys with knowledge to find that out!	1	3
why does it seem that no matter how hard you try.....?	we don't judge a book by it's cover why do men women judge how we look beauty is skin deep look at all the qualities you have brains good looking confidence your are self assured of your self you are a beautiful person. thank you	0	2
why does it seem that no matter how hard you try.....?	They are all self centered and just crazy & immature these days. It would be nice if we could go back in time like some of those old movies and all of them were gentlemen and full of chivalry and prided themselves on good morals. I'm affraid that will never be again. But do not give up!!! There are a few, you just have to know where to look and which ones to avoid. Guys stick labels on girls fat, skinney, not popular, easy, etc. so us girls can have labels for them too. Jerk, man whore, meyth head,   wild,  etc. we have to start sterotyping them if we don't want to get hurt. It's usually the one you don't notice, the one in the not so popular crowd, maybe just plain. They might be the one that will be very kind and cherish you & and make you happy. Don't go for the ones everybody else if after, you will be in constant doubt and looking over your shoulder to see if someone is checking your man out. I think security and being treated like a real person would be the ultimate happiness..Protect your heart just watch how many girls those popular guys go through. Don't be another notch in his belt.	0	2
why does it seem that no matter how hard you try.....?	Amen sister.  That is what I have been saying.  Everywhere I go I see these little blond morons being adored by guys who only care about getting laid.  I don't know why this happens, but lets face it, guys are just plain shallow.  The good news is there are a few good guys out there who aren't obsessed with dating a supermodel.  I know everyone says that but I have seen it happen.  My friend is engaged now, she is really tall and used to be super skinny (she was anorexic).  Now she is better, and has put on a little weight, but she is still very pretty.  She has been with her boyfriend throughout all of her weight fluctuations and he always tells her she is beautiful.  I am also a big woman, so I know what it is like to be ignored when you go to a club or a bar, or only to be thought of as a friend of the girls the guys really want.  But hey, I think I will meet someone eventually and I am not going to waste my time worrying what a bunch of jerks think about me.  Cuz I know I am a good person and any guy would be lucky to have me.  So I am going with the flow and I'm not going to obsess over meeting a guy.  Cuz you know the minute you stop looking is when you meet someone.  So hold your head up and remember that those empty-headed girls will be wrinkled has-beens in about 20 or so years, depending on how much tanning they do.  And we will still have our brains and wit.	0	2
why does it seem that no matter how hard you try.....?	Because looks are important too.  If you say that guys should appeal to brains more than looks, then what makes it any different than guys appearing to looks more than brains? Both require favoritism toward the other, and both are important.  To imply one should be empasized over the other, gives empasize that the other should also be emphasized over the other as well. However, the truth is that both are important, and one's personal preference is no different than your personal preference.	1	3
why does it seem that no matter how hard you try.....?	Everyone has a standard, something that makes them happy, turns them on.  Some guys I know wont date a woman who is under 250 lbs.  Others prefer legs, some pretty faces.  Best of luck :)	1	4
why does it seem that no matter how hard you try.....?	I don’t think it’s only guys..  girls also date people based on their appearance... but when you think about it... what's the first thing you see when you look at someone? What they look like! You can't look at a person and get an outline of all of their qualities and especially not their range of knowledge. It’s just life. But I must say, if you have to continuously try to make yourself noticed by someone, why would you be interested in this person anyway? There are billions and billions of people in the US alone… why stress out over one person that hasn’t noticed you? Just because they are smart and funny and have everything you look for in a person??  I doubt that, that ONE person is the only one with those qualities. Just keep looking…believe it or not there are a lot of nice sexy people in the world who's main interest isn't only to have a good looking girl/guy on their arm.	1	4
why does it seem that no matter how hard you try.....?	Its because morality now lives in the drains. Not in the individuals.	1	3
why does it seem that no matter how hard you try.....?	Simply enough, love is not a matter of the mind, dear.	1	3

You massage it in, leave it on for a few minutes then wash it off.  It's been the best product I used so far for oiliness because it doesn't irritate my skin or leave it red and flaky.  A 4oz bottle is $12 (a little expensive if you don't like it) but it's worth trying.	1	4

And you tend to eat less. Hope that helps.	1	4
why is organic all natural food  more expensive?	organic all natural food is more expensive because it is organic and all natural (sounds stupid but true).  people want it, so the price goes up.  the reason the other food is cheap is because nobody really cares and wants it.	1	4
why is organic all natural food  more expensive?	grown in greenhouses, takes more care and time	1	3
why is organic all natural food  more expensive?	Because the products and the chemicals are not healthy for our bodies. The production companies know that, but in order to get their products to sell, they have to sell it cheap. People will quickly buy the food that's on sale rather than buying the organic one that is very expensive. Overall, what you should understand is that the foods with perservatives and chemicals are being sold at alarming rate becauce 1. it is cheap 2. very tasty and 3. easy to get. That is why the production companies will not lose profit since they are producing a surplus of foods with chemicals and perservatives.	1	3

why is organic all natural food  more expensive?	If you load up food with preservatives it lasts longer which means you can leave it on the shelf longer making it more likely to be bought.  That means the seller doesn't have to charge as much to recoup his costs.	1	3
why is organic all natural food  more expensive?	It takes more time and care since they can't use bad chemicals.  They are produced at much slower rate than non-organic foods	1	4
why is organic all natural food  more expensive?	Food that is truly organic (and a lot of what is on your grocery store shelves is questionable), requires that you grow smaller fields, rotate your crops, and generally that you produce much less food than factory farms.  Think 10-20 acres, instead of 1000-2000 acres.  Additionally, truly organic farms value diversified crops.  Your conventional corn at the store comes from a farm that grows corn--  thousands upon thousands of acres of corn.  This creates issues with the crops, and isn't really good for the land, but it's a cheap way to grow corn.  An organic farm generally grows many different fruits and vegetables.  . . Now, back to my statement at the beginning.  Much of what you see in the stores now that is certified organic does not contain pesticides, but it is still grown in a factory setting.  So, that's why the prices are cheaper now than they were ten years ago.  But it is also why the quality is not as good now.. . If you really want a quality product for less expensive than what you're paying in the grocery store, find a local farmer.  Many of them are not certified organic but are using organic methods.	1	4
why is organic all natural food  more expensive?	BECAUSE IT'S REAL!!! IT'S NOT FULL OF HORMONES, AND OTHER THINGS TO MAKE IT LOOK NICE!	1	3
why is organic all natural food  more expensive?	Non-organic food is mass produced on mega-farms. Preservatives and pesticides solve the problems that go along with growing so many crops at one time and in one place, not to mention allowing for a longer time from harvest to consumption.. . Organic food is more expensive because it is more challenging to grow and usually done on a much smaller scale.	1	4
why is organic all natural food  more expensive?	because more is lost to insects, heat, and disease since they dont use pesticides and all the other chemicals	1	4

"Well, the insurance companies COUNT three years, but more than likely, a detailed CLUE report will SHOW some information from the seven years ago.

What is a schnitzel?	"Schnitzel (from the German Wiener Schnitzel, meaning veal fillet Viennese style) is one of the most famous traditional Austrian dishes. Possibly originating in Northern Italy (as cotoletta alla milanese), the recipe may have appeared in Vienna during the 15th or 16th century. According to another theory, it was introduced by Field Marshal Radetzky in 1857. The name ""Wiener schnitzel"" was coined in 1900.. . The schnitzel is prepared from a thinly-sliced piece of veal round, which is further tenderized by pounding with steak hammer, then successively dipped into wheat flour, eggs and breadcrumbs before being fried in clarified butter or lard. Sometimes the breadcrumbs are seasoned with freshly ground black pepper.. . Traditionally, Wiener schnitzel is served with potato salad and a lemon slice, but never with noodles. Roasted potatoes, french fries, rice or cranberry sauce are optional but considered bad cooking etiquette by purists. Unlike in Austria, it is served with gravy in Sweden. In Australia, schnitzel (often mispronounced ""snitzel"") has become a favourite ""pub meal"", usually made from beef or chicken rather than veal, and commonly served with gravy and chips (french fries) or as parmigiana topped with tomato sauce and cheese. In Israel, schnitzel (שניצל) refers to pounded chicken or turkey breasts, breaded or not. It is so popular as to be staple; ketchup and hummus are common condiments, while French fries and rice are common sides. Polish kotlet schabowy is similar, but lighter.. . Originally a festive dish—in the 17th and 18th centuries, sometimes gold dust was mixed into the breadcrumbs to provide an extra golden, luxurious colour—it has become one of the most popular meals among Austrians and is now enjoyed at all kinds of occasions. There are even Austrian fast food chains serving mostly schnitzels. Many restaurants offer cheaper schnitzels made from pork, and variants made of turkey have become popular more recently, but Austrian restaurant regulations require that ""vom Schwein"" (made of pork) or ""von der Pute"" (made of turkey) be indicated on the menu if no veal is used.. . Other variants of the Wiener schnitzel include:. . Cordon Bleu: ""Blue Ribbon"", two slices of meat filled with cheese and a slice of ham. . Jägerschnitzel: ""Hunter´s Schnitzel"", served with dark mushroom sauce. . Zigeunerschnitzel: ""Gipsy´s Schnitzel"", served with a sauce with pepper slices. . Rahmschnitzel: served with a sauce made of sour cream. . Hamburger Schnitzel: topped with a fried egg. . Chicken: Made of chicken, usually a cheaper alternative to others. . Turkey: Made of filet of turkey breast, very popular in Israel, often called the national dish. Many Israelis were of Viennese or German origin, but during the early years of the state, veal was unobtainable, and turkey proved an inexpensive and tasty substitute. . Vegetarian Schnitzel: Made of textured soy, tofu or seitan. The seasoning is in the breading so the consistency may differ slightly but the taste can be almost the same as that of a conventional Schnitzel."	1	4
What is a schnitzel?	Schnitzel is the GENERIC term for a breaded meat cutlet.  A schnitzel can be veal, beef, pork or chicken.  There are tons of different types of schnitzels, jaeger, weiner, the list goes on.	1	4
What is a schnitzel?	Some of the others almost got this one right, but not quite.  The root of the word is Schnit, which is German for cut.  A Schnitzel is a cutlet of meat.  It can be any meat, and it does not necessarily have to be breaded.  It is usually prepared by tenderizing it with a mallet and sauteeing it. As many already noted, the most common kind is Wiener Schnitzel, which gets its name from the city of Vienna (Wien, in German) where it originate, and it is typically made from veal, which is breaded and fried crisp.  Other kinds, however, are not necessary breaded and may be served with a gravy or cream sauce.	1	4

Why do random strangers keep asking me what ethnicity I am?	Maybe they are intrigued by you. But in any case it is totaly disrespectful and people in general should know better.	1	4
Why do random strangers keep asking me what ethnicity I am?	"I used to have platinum blonde hair and very often, people used to ask me, out of the blue, when we weren't even talking about origins, if I were Polish or Russian.

Why do random strangers keep asking me what ethnicity I am?	"Oh gosh, this was a daily occurence for me when I lived in the midwest.  I'm talking getting asked about my ethnicity, sometimes in a very rude way like ""what are you?"" by strangers multiple times a day.  When I lived in NYC I got asked less, and in London way less.  Some of it has to do with the culture in those places-- in the midwest it is socially acceptable to start conversations with strangers, while in London it's not so much.. . Sometimes, when it is men doing the asking, it is a really bad ""line"" and they think I am ""exotic"" and they like that.  That's the quickest way to make me walk away from you!. . But I think the main reason strangers ask someone that is indeed xenophobia, or fear of the ""other.""  Many people are uncomfortable with racial ambiguity.  Unfortunately, most of these people are not even aware of why they really want to know (nor are they aware that their question will be considered rude by most people).  Try challenging one of them and watch what happens-- they become very defensive.  If the question bothers you, you are under no obligation to be polite."	1	3

"Why is God ""male""?"	Unreason!. Nobody knows anything about God, I see no reason to imagine a God exists others do but it is purely speculation on their part.. Why would God require to be sexed..the whole idea of God and a God that has a sex is nonsense...if there is only one God who would he be mating with?...it's pure trash and illogic.. . There is no intellectual honesty in evidence with those who claim a God.	1	4

"Why is God ""male""?"	I don't know go ask him.	0	2
"Why is God ""male""?"	We are taught that God is male. It is Men who chose that God should be a male. Coming to think of it doesn't also imply sexism?	1	3
"Why is God ""male""?"	It's the version of god of the mideast religions that is 'male'.  That version is based on the Anannaki, not the creative force of the universe. There is no gender except in this physical dimension of ours.	1	3
"Why is God ""male""?"	During Biblical times, women were lower class...it never would have occurred to anyone to make God a woman.. . PS: I would strongly recommend you read Danielle's answer, or perhaps any of her answers for that matter...	1	3

"Why is God ""male""?"	He is a seminal force in nature. Look that word up.	1	3
"Why is God ""male""?"	God is both male and female in characteristics.  According to the bible, there is neither male nor female in heaven.   God is Father, but He is not a male like we are on earth.  God Himself is  Spirit. . . Do not try to figure Him out through sociology, psychology or through the Feminist Movement theories.  He is what He is!   He is not inntimidated by an American mindset.	1	3
"Why is God ""male""?"	"He is referred to as ""Father"" and the Bible uses male pronouns when speaking of Him.  Also, Jesus, who is God, was born a male.  Therefore God is male in aspect.  Remember, we were made in His image, therefore God could be of just one gender."	0	2
"Why is God ""male""?"	God is seen as male because of the male domination upon the earth.   Males use violence to achieve superiority.  But through mother nature god has had an ally in balancing the destruction of man.  The changes inputted by her are slower but non violent.  She is the inspiration behind, women's equality movements,  the hippie movement. and social consideration for the poor as well as children. She uses a non violent approach to influencing humanity.  She is not god the creator is, he will someday reflect what he truly is... a reflection of nature which is equally represented by male and female.... therefor it is more appropriate to call god IT.	1	4
"Why is God ""male""?"	adam was created in god's image, according to the bible, and we know he was male. eve was created later, as an afterthought.	1	3
"Why is God ""male""?"	Traditional religious literature tends to refer to god as male primarily because males are more dominant and since god is the supreme being he should not be classified as female.. . If you are looking for a more practical interpretation, then you should assume god has no gender, neither male nor female. We tend calssify everything in life. . In school we are taught about solids, liquids, gasses in chemistry.. . We classify people by age, gender, color, ethnic background etc. The question is do we need to classify god even though we do not know what god looks like?! I would say no, because god is a supreme being and we can not even start to imagine his physical appearance should he have one.	1	4
"Why is God ""male""?"	god isnt male. in my opinion god is neither. what i think is that the early church made god male in order to make the male gernder beter than that of female and it would also give them an excuse to not let them do any of the things men were alowed to do.	1	4
"Why is God ""male""?"	Judaism is a better authority on the nature of the biblical God than Christianity, which sprang from Judaism:. . In Judaism, God has no body, God is non-physical. Any mention of God's body is considered to be metaphorical.. . Any physical representation of God, such as the Golden Calf, is considered to be idolatry.. . As God has no body, He has no gender.. . While God is referred to in masculine terms and the Shechinah (Divine presence that fills the universe) is referred to in feminine terms, God is actually neither male nor female.	1	3
"Why is God ""male""?"	neither God is male nor female. because God cannot be like us	0	2
"Why is God ""male""?"	"we do not know if God is male or female. but it would appear that ""he"" is used frequently. there is no information about it. he is not like us humans therfore he cant be a he or a she. what is mother nature? he or she? how do u know?"	1	3

"Why is God ""male""?"	"God is not necessarily male.  Jesus once described the angels as not being male or female as we know it.  I think they had to come up with a way to describe God that was more respectful than calling ""him"" ""it""."	1	4

How to study 17-18 hrs a day?give me practical tips.........?	Studying 17-18 hours a day is actually not a good idea.  I only spend 5-8 hours a day studying and it requires a lot of concentration.  Way back when I really study hard for my every subject as I need to maintain my grades.  I do not watch TV except for weekends.  . . Actually, studying needs a lot of discipline.  To give you some tip on how I can take studying too long up to 8 hours, well, after 30 mins., I rest for about 5 mins. to unwind myself then go back again to what am I studying about.  Next, I make sure that I am in a good condition to study my lessons and refrain myself from excuses like... okay, I will watch TV first or I will do my project next day.  If there is enough time, I will advance all my projects and do my assignments although it is not due on the next day.  In this way, I avoid myself cramming and staying late at night.  Some people said that mornings are the ideal time to study because your mind is relax and all the info will sip in your mind.  . . Spending 17-18 hours a day will make you burn out and sick physically. I don't think a genius do this.  I don't know about scientists...	1	4

How to study 17-18 hrs a day?give me practical tips.........?	Don't, you deluded fool. Study smart, not hard.	0	2
How to study 17-18 hrs a day?give me practical tips.........?	Gosh, why do you need to study that long? It will take almost all of your time just for studying which is unbalanced for a person. You must also try to take some time to play or rest other than merely studying.. . But then, if you really want to study for so many hours in a day. I suggest that you find more ways of making study easier and more interesting in either way.. . Set a time-table of what you want to do from Monday to Friday. Make sure you follow the time-table and do what you planned. You can also give choices for yourself such as planning two subjects at the same time so that you can choose which one to study for. Make it at least 30 minutes for one easier subject and at least 1 hour for those which are more difficult. Make sure you know how many subjects you want to study and don't miss out even one of it.. . Find some ways to make studying more interesting so that you won't mind studying for 17-18 hours in a day. For example, surf the net to find interesting informations based on the topic you will be studying as some extra informations. You can also surf the net to get some ideas in decorating your notes or making your notes more interesting to read which can be by drawing funny pictures to represent some important points to remember. Drawing simple script of comics can also help you to remember the facts which are longer easily if you know how to draw it out.. . Other than that, I would certainly give you the suggestion to find some movies in connected to the topic you are studying so that it will be more interesting to study rather than just reading from books if you hate reading a lot. Watching movies can also help you to remember more on the topic which is related. Some channels such as the NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC, ANIMAL PLANET or DISCOVERY CHANNEL can be watched if you would like to find some documentary shows based on scientific findings.. . Slide shows can be home-made if you cooked up the correct recipe. You can make it interesting by making notes into a slide show so that you can watch it as well as revising for your studies which can be more interesting if there is some funny pictures connected to the topic. Sometimes you can also invent ways to make studying easier and more fun. Symbols which you understand can be invented so that you can remember things easier.. . If you like musics, you can also play some classical or romantic musics as the background when you are studying so that you won't feel sleepy or bored.. . I don't know which way you will like but I sure hope I can help you in some way, somehow. Good luck for your studies too!	1	3

People have reported many sightings of it and there are several pictures of the sightings. I lived in Vernon B.C. three years ago and a team of scientists from  ( I think ) Japan were were living on a boat on the lake doing research and hoping to catch some film footage of Ogopogo.  Some believe that it really does exist and may be a mutation of some large fish species or a creature that has not fully evolved from the prehistoric days. People travel to the area from around the world hoping to catch a glimpse of it.  I added some web sites that might interest to you.  The first site in the list is photo's of ogopogo.

What is the most important number, and why?	1 is the most important number, it stands for (YOU)!	1	3
What is the most important number, and why?	Since this question is listed in philosophy, I would say it is a toss-up between between the numbers 1, 2, and 3. The number 1 in my mind does not represent one person. What it represents is God, and without God, we would not be here. The number 2 would represent Jesus Christ, as the Second Member of the Godhead. Without Jesus Christ, there would be no way to return to the presence of God, and we would be stuck with the consequences of sin in this life with no way to progress and change. Neither would we have the hope for the resurrection, as we would all die and never be reunited with our physical bodies, as none of us have that information or capability. The number 2 is also important because it represents marriage - you need a man and a woman to have children. Without those two people (as a Christian I would say Adam and Eve) you would not have the rest of the human race. I would also say the number 3 is important because it represents the Godhead (or what Protestants and other Christians would call the Trinity) - and the third member of the Godhead is the Holy Ghost. Without His influence we would never be sure if we had truly encountered truth or not, because it is His function to testify to us of God, Jesus Christ, and eternal truths through simple and peaceful, energetic feelings. I do appreciate the other answers here - and I agree the number 0 is important in mathematics especially.	1	4

Why do dog go bathroom on the funiture?	He is marking his territory, the higher the mark the more status (so he thinks). You are not the boss, he is. You can be boss.	1	4
Why do dog go bathroom on the funiture?	because now that the dog urinates anywhere even furniture, they've actually marked their territory. now the urine scent is deep rooted w/in the furniture. dog's have an awesome sense of smell, so they can continue smelling their scent on the furniture. they'll continue going on & to the same spot.. it takes quite a while, a long time for the urine scent to go away. to the dog's though, it may never go away. the more the dog pee's in that same particular spot: the scent will remain.. throw away the furniture & get new ones.. what you do is, put the dogs nose in the area, speak firmly no: no pee-pee, then put the dog outside to go. you can also spank the dog in the booty softly w/a newspaper too. that's b/4 putting the dog outside.	1	4

why receptors are good drug target?	Because the drug binds to it. When the drug binds to the receptor, the drug begins to work.	1	4
why receptors are good drug target?	Also it's easy to design a drug to inhibit a receptor.  Its hard to design a drug to get into the cell and interact with a cytosolic protein and block it's action.	0	2
why receptors are good drug target?	because drugs are similar in structure to the neurotransmitters that bind to receptors	1	4
why receptors are good drug target?	Because receptors transmit extracellular messages into intracellular responses.  Thus, by targeting a receptor with a drug you can either activate (agonist) a specific cellular activity or block it (antagonist).	1	4
why receptors are good drug target?	i will have to work off of a few assumptions but:. . brain receptors: most particularly those for dopamine control many of the emotions we feel. When good things happen, fun, exiting things, our brain releases dopamine and you get a good, happy feeling.. certain recreational drugs (cocaine, meth, extacy) force your brain to release elevated levels of dopamine to produce a very powerful happy feeling. a 'high'.	1	4

Use Tea Tree Oil on them to help them heal faster. Call around for a dermatologist and specifically ask if they know how to treat HS. So few doctors do, but it could possibly require surgery.	1	4
Why doesn't glue stick to the inside of the bottle?	It appears that the question period has expired. If you have received an answer that meets your needs, please choose a 'best answer.'. Regards.	1	4
Why doesn't glue stick to the inside of the bottle?	Hmm.  That's probably because when glue sticks, it dries.  Think about it.  Whenever you used to make crafts as a kid, the more glue you used, the longer it took to dry.  There is SO much glue in the bottle that it can't really dry because there is so much of it and it isn't exposed to air very much.  And because it doesn't dry, it doesn't stick.  Wet glue doesn't hold, dry glue does(once again remember those crafts as a kid:  you didn't mess with it till you knew the glue had dried and it was finally stuck)  Get it??	1	4
Why do you read?	First and foremost I read for enjoyment.  Books can help you escape a mundane existence - they can educate you - they can entertain you - they can thrill you - they can frighten you - they can expand your horizons - they can expand your vocabulary - they can relax you - they can make you tense - they can be what you look forward to opening first chance you get - they can be sadly missed once you have finished the last chapter - they can be revisited like an old friend - and they can make you knowledgeable on an awful lot of subjects - and they can adorn your bookshelves. Take your pick!	1	4

Why do you read?	We learn from books. Think about our childhood. We started to read books to acquire knowledge. In course of time we have reached to a place where we could not be without the knowledge we gained from books. . . Then reading books is the best way to spend our leisure. We get immense pleasure when we read books of our choice.. . It also fulfills our aim in life. If we want to become a professional we have to study in the particular field and after successful completion of academic session we reach our goal of selecting the profession.. . Many things can be told about reading books but the space and time is limited to do so.	1	4
Why do you read?	"It can be classified into two aspects. I read because I want to learn more new and difficult vocabularies.

Reading helps me improve in the academic results..      ""Reading is Fun"", and I agree with this. Because it is exciting to read the detective stories, the ghost stories, so on and so on, I can relax and it's a kind of leisure for me."	1	4

Sociology, the scientific study of societies and social life in general, develops our social awareness and helps us both to understand the nature of societal problems and to find appropriate ways of responding to them.. . .  sociology is interested in the relationship between economic phenomena and society as a whole. The students of sociology are provided with tools to observe economic and business life from a broader perspective. . Sociological theories have had a great influence on the development of other social sciences, and taking economic sociology as a major or minor subject provides an effective way to support studies undertaken in other subjects that involve economics and busin	1	4

Is more difficult to train a male versus a female?	Males are usually easier to train than females for women, but your dogs (regardless of their sex) have to see you as the aplha, aka leader of the pack, since dogs are pack animals they look for a leader, and if there isn't one then a dog will try to become the alpha.  Every dog is different and some dogs are natural alpha dogs, others are just content to be part of any pack, so it may be that you have a male who is naturally driven to be a leader and a female who just wants to be loved.  Try to find a reputable training school where they can help with different techniques for different dogs (if they are teaching the same thing for every dog then find a different plkace).  Dogs are just like raising kids, what works for one child does not necessarily work for the other, but the more time you spend working with the dogs, the more you will know how to make the dogs and you happy!	1	4
Is more difficult to train a male versus a female?	You can see by all the different experiences and advice that all dogs are different. I have had the best luck training males over females. I find their personalities easier to work with. . . I am sure the breed makes a difference too. They are like us in as much as they are all different. That is why I love them so much, you will never find two alike.................... . . MAGGIE 71: WHY do you have a dog? You keep him outside during the day and in a crate at night. WHY don't you find him a good home with human contact and kindness?	1	3
Is more difficult to train a male versus a female?	Males are definitely more difficult to train.	1	3
Is more difficult to train a male versus a female?	yes it is defiantly harder to train males over females. males are the more dominate gender in the Wilde and it is an instinct thing to be stubborn and try to control others. all you have to do is teach him who is boss but don't be to mean, animals are living things with feelings.	1	3
Is more difficult to train a male versus a female?	I THINK MALES ARE HARDER TO TRAIN THAN FEMALE(BY MY PERSONAL EXPERIENCE) I HAVE A FEMALE DOBERMAN AND A MALE AMERICAN BULLDOG,AND SHE WAS A BREEZE TO TRAIN BUT HE WAS VERY DIFFICULT AND HE STILL IS..SHE IS CALM AND HE IS SO HYPER HE KNOCKS ALL MY STUFF OFF MT STANDS.. I LOVE HIM DEARLY BUT HE IS SOMETIMES A PAIN IN THE ASS..I WILL NOT GET ANOTHER MALE,I LIKE MY FEMALES..THEY ALSO SEEM TO BE MORE PROTECTIVE OVER THE FAMILY,WHERE ALL THE MALES I HAVE HAD WERE WAY TO FRIENDLY TO STRANGERS..MY AUSTRALIAN SHEPHERD WHO WAS A MALE WAS THE BEST DOG OUT OF ANY OF MY OTHER MALES..BUT ANY AUSSIE ARE VERY INTELLIGENT DOGS ANYHOW..	1	3

Is more difficult to train a male versus a female?	Hi,. . I can SO relate to you on this because I too have a male shih tzu as well as a female. My female to me has seemed easier to train than my male. I believe the males tend to be more stubborn. My male is just as sweet but can be very stubborn at times! Good luck with your male..and his training.	1	3
Is more difficult to train a male versus a female?	neuter him . or do what i had to do i put him outside during the day . and put him in a crate at night. male shih tzu can be trained but its extremly hard	1	3
Is more difficult to train a male versus a female?	Males can be more difficult because they try to be the top dog or alpha male. Be stern with your commands and consistant. The number one problem people have is that if there is more than 1 person in the house both people don't react the same when they train the dog. Be firm consistant and loving when they do the right thing. Dogs both male and female have a strong desire to please their masters. I train and install invisible dog fences. I have yet to meet a dog that did not listen to me. I do not react if they growl at me but instead use a warm tone until I win them over. The dog don't sense fear so the see me as the ALPHA male and submit. Remember Firm consistant training will always work over yelling and abuse a happy dog is a good dog.	1	4
Is more difficult to train a male versus a female?	this I think is partly breed dependent - Males actually tend to have a tad more sucess with formal training in my breed (whippet) But a lot of people claim the opposite for many harding breeds.. Don't foget there are individual differences too	1	3
Is more difficult to train a male versus a female?	yes,because males are more stubbern.females usually coroperate better then males.	0	2

why does taco bell always make me nauseas?	i used to work at a taco bell on a military base, and for the most part, we had a LOT of return customers, mainly because the taco bell was on a military base. a lot of people there were so used to it, maybe its just because its a grade of food that is still safe to eat, its just processed to the point that your body reacts adversely to it and you get the upset stomach and such.	1	4

What does the Bible mean by calling Pride a deadly sin?	pride essentially is what sin is, it is believing that what you do is right regardless of what God says. and it is the deadliest sin because it is the only one that you are blind to.	1	4
What does the Bible mean by calling Pride a deadly sin?	"""lasermouse"" is incorrect, it IS in the Bible, you remember ""seven things doth the Lord hate, a prideful heart, a lying tongue..."" etc.. . It's considered a deadly sin because it is one that can actually kill you."	1	3
What does the Bible mean by calling Pride a deadly sin?	I guess that Lucifer started taking his eyes off of God then started noticing his own luminance until he completely kept his eyes off of God then concentrated mainly on himself to the point where he became puffed up, conceited and so far away from God that he considered himself better and more powerful than God?	1	4
What does the Bible mean by calling Pride a deadly sin?	"Proverbs 6:17 mentions ""a proud look"" as one of the things that God hates.  I believe that this is a deadly sin because you are loving yourself and trying to prove yourself to others instead of trying to be the best Christian in God's eyes.  It doesn't matter what other people think, all that matters is your personal devotion to God.  Being in pursuit of things that will make you more proud of yourself is going after earthly things, which are not important in the long run."	1	4
What does the Bible mean by calling Pride a deadly sin?	Thomas Aquinas wrote the seven deadly sins some time during the seventh or eight centuries. they are not from the bible. and pride was included because he believed that a prideful person would put them self a head of god.	1	4
What does the Bible mean by calling Pride a deadly sin?	Pride is deadly in ANY religion. . . In Gnosticism, it is called ego. If fact Carl Jung was Gnostic and based many of his writings about Psychology on those beliefs. He was also influenced by Buddhism and Hinduism.. . The Buddha said all the self is created by the ego. That in really the person and the individual does not exist. . . I am surprised that with the Church philosophy and the pride and ego of the pope and bishops that they even allowed that scripture to stay in the Bible.. . huntjames32 and lasermouse are in error saying that it is not in the Bible. Locations are Proverbs 8:13says, God hates pride, James 4:6 tells us that God resists the proud. Proverbs 16:18, Pride goes before destruction. Prov. 6:16-19 list the seven things God hates.. . Thomas Aquinas and the Catholic Church took credit for for something wise King Solomon wrote three thousand years ago.    Of course, when has telling the TRUTH ever mattered to them?	1	4
What does the Bible mean by calling Pride a deadly sin?	that you're really in trouble.	0	2
What does the Bible mean by calling Pride a deadly sin?	When one gains enough wisdom to see the hand of God in all things, then one can understand why a man claiming credit for Gods grace might be upsetting to God.. . This I believe; . http://homelessheart.com/testimony.htm	0	2

why is it so easy to be bad?	Being bad is the way of the devil, who is inferior to God. God created everything, including the devil.. Now think about it, God invites you to be a shadow of Him, by doing good and spreading joy and good deeds. The devil, who is but a pawn, is asking you to join him in hell, by doing bad stuff, which bring instant joy and pleasure, as well as rapture. . The way of God takes a long time, and a lot of patience, to reach an eternal paradise, that haven't been seen or heard about.

Why does my nextel turn off by itself?	Your phone is turning off by itself most likely because Nextel phones have below average battery standby time. In other words it has to do with the battery and the operating system for the phone. My suggest would be to get with another cell phone company if the phone has given you too many problems.	1	4
Why does my nextel turn off by itself?	I would say the battery also.  Also I'm not sure why that person posted that nextel battery standby battery times are bad.  Mine lasts for almost 2 days without being plugged in and charges in less than a half an hour for full power.	1	4
Why does my nextel turn off by itself?	Because it is a safety feature on the phone.  There is a way to turn the feature off but, I myself am still trying to figure that out.	1	3
Why does my nextel turn off by itself?	If the battery's low it will automaticlly power down.	1	3
Why does my nextel turn off by itself?	pleae recharge the battery. also if it happens too often then buy a new battery as the old one seems to be not strong enough	1	4
Why does my nextel turn off by itself?	My nextel was doing the same thing i have an i860. What it was, was a short with the button because the side of it started to come loss, but if you take it to a repair shop they will be able to fix it for you.	1	4
Why does my nextel turn off by itself?	My Nokia does the same thing, it is most likley battery related, but when you rule that out like I did, you have the phones operating system acting up, just like windows for the pc.	1	4

Why does my nextel turn off by itself?	It might have a low battery.	1	3
-how does playing pool deal with science?	It deals with geometry in that you have to set up proper angles and predict where the ball should end using multiple angles. It also deals with physics in that you have ot control how hard you calculate your shot in order to end in a specific location, as well as things like friction coefficients, ball speed, ball rotation and spin, energy transfer, energy loss, and other aspects that you normaly dont think about when playing  a rack in your local bar.	1	4
-how does playing pool deal with science?	1) There are a lot of angles that are factored.. 2) The transfer of energy from one ball to another. 3) The friction of the carpet, chalk on pool cue, etc..	1	3
-how does playing pool deal with science?	Its a practical use of collision theories (involving all the above, geometry, action vs reaction, forces, spin, etc.)	1	4
-how does playing pool deal with science?	You hit the Que Ball with the right Force and angle, you can pocket every single shot. It is all about angles and 2D forces, but it can get a little more complex ;)	1	4
-how does playing pool deal with science?	While playing pool you are dealing with angles like in geometry. Playing pool is fun but also helps you learn somthing.	1	4
-how does playing pool deal with science?	Well, you use geometry with every shot. . Also there is a transfer of energy when one ball hits another, which happens every shot as well (unless the cue ball misses the target completely)	1	4
-how does playing pool deal with science?	Yeah, you use angles to determine where the ball will go and where it will end up.. . I suck at pool.	1	3
-how does playing pool deal with science?	Geometry - angles to bounce and rebound on target. 3 1/2 x 7 or 4 x 8 table, the angles are the same. . Inertia - to stick a ball or spin it so it goes where you want. . Laws of motion - to move and object in one direction whne hit with a different direction	1	4
-how does playing pool deal with science?	It is a practial application of geometry.	1	3
-how does playing pool deal with science?	All of the above plus the psychology of psyching out your opponent, and the physiology of the effect of alcohol on your mental focus, and your ability to hold your cue. (2 pints of bitter works for me.)	1	4
-how does playing pool deal with science?	It doesnt really do with science as much as math.  All the angles involved with getting the balls in the pocket, especially in the bank shots where you have a vertex are all geometery.	1	4

Its the amount of people that makes the difference of the 1st world from the 3rd world.If honestly done the survey of corruption in a society,I dont think the ratio would be any different fron one world to another.And why population increases,well thats a big field to study.Let me tell you a story--I cant remember the time,probably in the late seventies or early 8o's that New-york had a black-out in electricity for a couple of hours and that year,Newyork had a baby boom.Now consider the black-outs cause by lack of electricity in the poor countries-every day,every week,every month.What do you think will be the only entertainment people would enjoy.......?.....:-)	1	4

how can ppl tell if they r bipolar?	Bipolar is when an individual has sudden mood changes...contrary to belief symtoms include more than just being moody and angry. Any behavior changes such as sudden boosts of energy and feeling down one minute to extremely confident the next. I can not say that an individual could be half bipolar but can show the symptoms without actually being diagnosed as bipolar. I suggest researching this subject...You will be surprised by the actual definition ...	1	4
how can ppl tell if they r bipolar?	I know a little about thuis, but I think this webpage explains it best	0	2
how can ppl tell if they r bipolar?	well those who are bipolar change moods alot and very quickly, literally. one moment they can be determined to finish a project then one second later they'll just suddenly decide to go exercise. they have a problem with finishing things. but to get more info go to a website like webmd.com they have a lot of info. or do some research...wikipedia might have something. and depression is believed to be a chemical imbalance. where no matter how hard you try you find it very difficult to be happy. this can affect your daily life if not treated, sometimes it can lead to suicide because you believe you are worthless and meaningless. . . but i'm not a doctor, so if you think you or someone else is bipolar or depressed, you should go see a doctor to get professional help.	1	4
how can ppl tell if they r bipolar?	The only way you can tell if someone is bipolar is if they fit certain criteria. No, one can NOT be half bipolar.. Depression is an illness which may be brought on by many causes. There are several different types of depression, and each are treated differently. For example, there is Situational Depression, Seasonal Depression, Major Depression, I believe there are 8 different kinds.. As for BPD(Bipolar disorder), or Manic Depression, one would have to have several features of this disorder, in order to be diagnosed with specific disorder. Bipolar is a cyclic disorder, where a person doesn't sleep for extended periods of time, are VERY active though not always productive, during those times, then after being awake for this period, basically crash... HARD. This is when the depression kicks in, and it's a DEEP depression... which lasts until the next cycle of mania occurs. Usually, this cycle is over several months, the highs followed by the lows. Thus my reason one can not be half bipolar. If you want to seek more knowledge, look into getting a book called the DSM-IV. It lists all of the criteria for each of the mental disorders.	1	4
How is splitting a laser beam dangerous?	The only reason it might be dangerous is that the direction of the reflected beam is hard to control if you're just holding the splitter. The same would be true of a mirror. A small laser pen is uncomfortable if you flash someone in the eye, but the blink reflex is generally fast enough to prevent injury.	1	4

what is the procedure for getting a paternity test?	Labcorp is a national company that does testing.  Its about $300.  They swab the inside of the child's mouth, the potential father's mouth, and the mother's mouth if she is available.  It is most accurate when all three are present.  It takes several weeks to process the test.  I work with foster children so I have seen it done many times.. . Good luck, I hope this helps.	1	4
what is the procedure for getting a paternity test?	either when you go to court for child support, custody if he wants one he has to request one to the judge. or you can look in a phone book but it costs an arm and a leg...	1	3
what is the procedure for getting a paternity test?	DNA test of the father / mother and the son / daughter. The results of these DNA test analysis    confirm the paternity or otherwise.. . A paternity test is conducted to prove paternity, that is, whether a man is the biological father of another individual. This may be relevant in view of rights and duties of the father. Similarly, a maternity test can be carried out. This is less common, because at least during childbirth, except in the case of a pregnancy involving embryo transfer or egg donation, it is obvious who the mother is.. . This by DNA analysis of the three individuals, although older methods have included ABO blood group typing, analysis of various other proteins and enzymes, or using HLA antigens. For the most part however, DNA has all but taken over all the other forms of testing.. . The DNA of an individual is almost exactly the same in each and every somatic cell. Sexual reproduction brings the DNA of both parents together randomly to create a unique combination of genetic material in a new cell, so the genetic material of an individual is derived from the genetic material of their parents. This genetic material is known as the nuclear genome of the individual, because it is found in the nucleus.. . Comparing the DNA sequence of an individual to that of another individual can show if one of them was derived from the other or not. Specific sequences are usually looked at to see if they were copied verbatim from one of the individual's genome to the other. If that was the case, then this proves that the genetic material of one individual was derived from that of the other (i.e.: one is the parent of the other). Besides the nuclear DNA in the nucleus, the mitochondria in the cells also have their own genetic material termed the mitochondrial genome. Mitochondrial DNA comes only from the mother, without any shuffling.. . Proving a relationship based on comparison of the mitochondrial genome is much easier than that based on the nuclear genome. However, testing the mitochondrial genome can only prove if two individuals are related by common descent through maternal lines only from a common ancestor and is thus of limited value (for instance, it could not be used to test for paternity).. . Obtaining news that a child either is or isn't one's own is something that a parent or erstwhile parent can undertake at their own expense, without necessarily informing anyone either about the test or its result. However this situation will change when the Human Tissue Act comes into force in the UK in April 2006. Section 45 states that it will be an offence to possess any bodily material intending that any human DNA in the material be analysed without qualifying consent. . Tests can also be ordered by courts when proof of paternity is required	1	4

what is the procedure for getting a paternity test?	Generally, it is necessary to knock the man out, drag his unconsious body to the lab, have his blood drawn, and have the lab compare his DNA to that of the baby (whose blood also has to be drawn, but the baby can remain consious).	1	3
what is the procedure for getting a paternity test?	Depends on what you need it for.. . For child support?  Contact family court.. Or you can simply get it done on your own if both parties agree to it.. . There are many companies who will do it.  All you need is samples then mail it to them along with a fee.  just do a search for paternity test or dna test. . good luck	1	4

Why do hot molecules move faster than cold molecules?	its the other way round. a thing is hot if its molecules are moving with a higher thermal velocity (prop to T^1/2). if you heat something its molecular vibrations go up in turn increasing its temperature.	1	4
Why do hot molecules move faster than cold molecules?	I'm not exactly sure what a hot molecule looks like.. . If you heat up a solid, the energy goes into increasing the vibration of the molecules, but they aren't going anywhere, so they aren't any faster.. . A car full of hot molecules only looks like it is going faster down the street.. . If you throw a hot potato the molecules move at the same speed as a cold potato thrown with the same force.  But you tend to get rid of the hot potato faster.. . If you heat up molasses you change its viscosity, so it pours out of the can faster.  The heat reduces the resistence to flow by overcoming the counteracting forces.. . Sure hope this helps.	1	4
Why do hot molecules move faster than cold molecules?	Are you talking about coffee molecules?	0	1
Why do hot molecules move faster than cold molecules?	Kinetic energy can be expressed as:. . KE = (1/2) m v^2. . m = mass of the molecule. v = velocity of the molecule. . From kinetic temperature, this can also be expressed as:. . KE = (3/2) k T. . k = Boltzmann's constant. T = temperature. . Equating the two expressions:. . (1/2) m v^2 = (3/2) k T. . we see that v^2 is proportional to T. Therefore, as temperature rises, so does velocity.	1	4
Why do hot molecules move faster than cold molecules?	What do you mean by hot molecules and cold molecules? I have not heard so far about such molecules.. . If you mean by ‘hot molecules’ the molecules of substance which are at high temperature, the answer is follows.. . But before answering, I want to know why you call them as hot molecules.. .  You refer faster molecules as hot molecules and slow molecules as cold molecules.. . That means you know the faster the molecules the hotter is the substance and vice versa.. . The slower the molecules the colder is the substance and vice versa.. . It seems you know the answer well.	1	3
Why do hot molecules move faster than cold molecules?	You're getting down to the level that only philosophy can answer.  Science doesn't answer why, only how.. . Science will tell you that when an electron is excited, it will will emit photons and move to a different electron shell.  If you ask why, nobody knows.	1	4
Why do hot molecules move faster than cold molecules?	as best I can tell....:.   when materials get hot, that is just heat energy being absorbed by the molecules. When the molecules recieve energy, the electrons become exited and start going faster and faster. In any material, the molecules are in constant motion, so when the electrons speed up, so do the molecules in motion. That is why things liquify and evaporate, because the molecules are moving so fast and bump the other molecules apart.	1	4
Why do hot molecules move faster than cold molecules?	any particle has an internal energy =. kinetic +potential+ vibrational+..........etc.... . so when molecules are heated the internal energy increases, so to a little kinetic enegy.. so they are slower.	1	4

Why do hot molecules move faster than cold molecules?	they are all the same molecules they're movement gives them heat	1	3
Why do hot molecules move faster than cold molecules?	Because they have more energy of course. And i think they've to keep moving because they've no energy storage. So, they've no option but to use it. And not all molecules move you know, molecules in solid objects only vibrate. So if they are hot, they just vibrate faster.	1	4
Why do hot molecules move faster than cold molecules?	because they have higher energy	1	3

Why do space shuttles move when the rockets are fired but not when water is ejected?	The ejection of water WILL effect the shuttles attitude (direction). Any mass accelerated out will have an equal and opposite force against the shuttle (Newton's laws). But as it happens, the on board gyroscope detects minor forces causing permutations to the craft and compensates with thrusters.	1	4
Why do space shuttles move when the rockets are fired but not when water is ejected?	you are talking about a totally different ball game.. water .. fire... different chemical reaction..	1	3
Why do space shuttles move when the rockets are fired but not when water is ejected?	If I understand what you're asking, then.... . I think that the space shuttles -don't- move when the water is ejected from it because the water does not give enough thrust for the shuttle to move. that's why we use those big-honkin' rockets; they give the shuttle enough thrust to get out of the earth's gravity.	1	4
Why do space shuttles move when the rockets are fired but not when water is ejected?	According to Newton's third law, gas, water or any other mass ejected by a spaceship produces a thrust. But in the specific case of the Space Shuttle hydrogen cells, I suppose the thrust is small enough to be negligible for operating the ship. Indeed, you have to consider that the quantity of water, and its speed are very little compared to rocket performances. Probably this water is cause of small asset deviations that have to be compensated real-time to maintain the nominal trajectory (i.e. it's more a problem than an advantage).	1	4
Why do space shuttles move when the rockets are fired but not when water is ejected?	The thrust produced by the ejected water is negligible compared to the thrust of the rocket engines and to the mass of the shuttle. And the water ejection system is designed to minimize problems caused even by minimal thrust, like starting rotation or tumbling. Check out NASA's web site.	1	4
Why do space shuttles move when the rockets are fired but not when water is ejected?	Actuallly, it does. The difference is the amount of force expended by each process. The rockets expend a force great enough to impel the shuttle. The shuttle has a rather significant mass. A=M/F. The force of the water is not great enough to move significantly the mass of the shuttle even if it is ejected at high velocity, though it would in fact move it a little. The rockets are fired periodically to correct the orbit of the shuttle.	1	4
Why do space shuttles move when the rockets are fired but not when water is ejected?	If NASA was feeling clever, the answer would be that they eject the same amount of water in opposite directions when they dump the stuff, thus canceling out the thrusts and saving on fuel! (Hope you're listening NASA...). . I suspect the compensation answers are actually right though.	0	2
Why do space shuttles move when the rockets are fired but not when water is ejected?	The rockets the shuttle uses for maneuvering in space have a specific impulse Isp of about 300 seconds. In simple terms, what that means is that burning 1 lb of propellant produces 300 lb-sec of impulse. Another interpretation is that the exhaust speed of the rockets is is Isp * g, or 300*32=9600 ft/sec. . In contrast, the waste water is ejected at a low speed, only about 30-75 ft/sec (ref.), and it only lasts a short time. So a water dump will only induce small unwanted angular and translational rates which are barely noticable. And, as other answerers have noted, the closed-loop attitude control system keeps the Shuttle within a small deadband of the desired attitude. The primary jets have a nominal thrust of 870 lb and the verniers 24 lb.. Other disturbances on the Shuttle have the potential to tax the attitude control system more severely. One of the major possibilities is Auxiliary Power Unit (APU) contingency venting, which would only be performed in case of a leak in the APU's fuel system. In this situation APU exhaust is vented as a gas, with several lb thrust which may persist for many minutes.	1	4
Why do space shuttles move when the rockets are fired but not when water is ejected?	Actually, ejecting water does affect the movement of the shuttle. The thrust is more noticeable with the rockets, but both cause thrust.	1	4
Why do space shuttles move when the rockets are fired but not when water is ejected?	It does affect the movement, they compensate for it.	1	4
"What can ""Check Engine"" light signify in my 94 plymoth voyager?"	Get a mechanic to check the code.  If you know a mechanically inclined person that knows what they're doing they can get a code reader from auto parts store and check the codes.  It is alot cheaper than taking it to the shop.	1	4

"What can ""Check Engine"" light signify in my 94 plymoth voyager?"	Check Engine can mean alot of things.  Take the car to a mechanic.	1	3
"What can ""Check Engine"" light signify in my 94 plymoth voyager?"	A myriad of issues. Go to a mechanic and tell 'em what's up. Better safe than sorry.	1	4
"What can ""Check Engine"" light signify in my 94 plymoth voyager?"	usually the check engine light means you have an emissions problem.	1	3
"What can ""Check Engine"" light signify in my 94 plymoth voyager?"	well i dont know how much experience i have but i can tell you about my truck. the engine light is on all the time since i baught the thing and i havent had a problem with it yet i believe its just a computer problem, if you turn your car off and unhook the battery cable at the negative end and wait 30 seconds it should reset but if not it could just be the computer.	1	3
"What can ""Check Engine"" light signify in my 94 plymoth voyager?"	It's your o2 sensor	0	2
"What can ""Check Engine"" light signify in my 94 plymoth voyager?"	time to see a mechanic.	1	3
"What can ""Check Engine"" light signify in my 94 plymoth voyager?"	Ok this is just a suggestion, and I may be wrong, but it could mean you should have a mechanic check the engine.	1	4
"What can ""Check Engine"" light signify in my 94 plymoth voyager?"	You should bring it to me i am a mechanic, i will charge you extra for asking this question.	0	2
"What can ""Check Engine"" light signify in my 94 plymoth voyager?"	Yep...what they said	0	1
"What can ""Check Engine"" light signify in my 94 plymoth voyager?"	"could be a lot of things.  The ""check enginge"" light means that something along the way isn't exactly right.  If you checked your oil, try checking your trans fluid.  Its the other dipstick on the engine block.  Try checking your air, fuel (wait till the car is TOTALLY cooled off), and oil (will require changing your oil) filters.  Could be one of those.  Check your brake fluid, as well as your radiator fluid and resevoire.  Also, check the fuses, both under the steering wheel and under the hood, for any burnt out fuses.. . Its hard to tell what it could mean if something is not OBVIOUSLY wrong.  If its not doing anything funny, then just call a mechanic or the dealer and see if at sometime in the near future you can go get it put on the Diagnostic tester.  It will cost you a chunk of change (especailly if you go to the dealer), but they will defanitely be able to tell you what is going on.  Also, give it a week or two, it might just be a glitch, it might just simply work itself out."	1	4
"What can ""Check Engine"" light signify in my 94 plymoth voyager?"	"Usually the ""Check Engine"" light on most cars comes on when there is a problem with the emissions systems.  I can't give you any better details though because it could be like 300 different things. Go to a mechanic and ask him to run your codes, or buy a code reader, called an OBD Scan Reader. They run from $50-150 at any auto parts store, and can be used over and over again; when you plug it into your car's fuse box, a number comes up on its screen. You get a book with the code reader; simply look up the number and you know what your problem is!"	1	4
Why are dead cockroaches always found lying on their backs instead of face down?	I think it's cause when they die of poisoning they kick around alot and they just flip over, . . and otherwise, how could you tell if they were dead or not?	1	4
Why are dead cockroaches always found lying on their backs instead of face down?	thats true...wow never thought of that!	0	2
Why are dead cockroaches always found lying on their backs instead of face down?	cos they die kicking and its easier to die kicking freely into the air than the ground	1	3
Why are dead cockroaches always found lying on their backs instead of face down?	They have to pray first?!?	1	3
Why are dead cockroaches always found lying on their backs instead of face down?	May be they just play dead, the same way dogs do. When you ask a dog to play dead, they also lie on their backs, too.	0	2
Why are dead cockroaches always found lying on their backs instead of face down?	I was denied a grant to fund a study of this exact question.	0	2
Why are dead cockroaches always found lying on their backs instead of face down?	Here is the answer:	0	1
Why are dead cockroaches always found lying on their backs instead of face down?	ok i have no clue cause i have never seen a cockroach in real life well maybe at the local zoo where they belong or maybe on fear factor	0	2
Why are dead cockroaches always found lying on their backs instead of face down?	I suppose since there body's contain mostly fluids while alive, that during the dehydration phase after death, the moisture evaporating happens from the easiest point of departure, their undercarriage, their body's flip.  I know the upper outer part of their body is usually heavily armored, so fluids would evaporate down, not up.  I am not sure, but that is my guess.  You do the research and let me know.	1	3
Why are dead cockroaches always found lying on their backs instead of face down?	They do that as a deathbed ritual.  Dr. Kevorkian fed them their medicine that way.	1	3
Why are dead cockroaches always found lying on their backs instead of face down?	First, few cockroaches die on their backs in the wild.  Natural death of cockroaches probably occurs in the stomach of a bird, bat or other small animal.. Second, Cockroaches are not used to living on a polished marble or vinyl floor.  They are more used to a ruguous living plane including leaves and sticks and other vegetable debris.  Thus when a cockroach finds itself on its back (by some mistake in its orienteering) it may have trouble righting itself if there is not debris around to grab hold of with its legs.  (Try it, put a cockroach on its back on a polished floor with and without some crinkled paper.). Third, often we come across dead cockroaches in buildings that have died of insecticide.  Most of these insecticides are organophosphate nerve poisons.  The nerve poison often inhibits cholinesterase, an enzyme that breaks down acetyl choline (ACh), a neurotransmitter.  With extra ACh in the nervous system, the cockroach has muscular spasms which often result in the cockroach flipping on its back.  Without muscular coordination the cockroach cannot right itself and eventually dies in its upside down-position.	1	4
What is the pH of a 0.4 M solution of CH3COONa?	A thorough perusal of your textbook should help with your problem.  Oh, wait--sorry, I forgot--you aren't interested in LEARNING how to calculate the pH of your sodium acetate solution, just in getting the quick fix answer from someone who has.	1	4
What is the pH of a 0.4 M solution of CH3COONa?	It's not really the answer, it's more complicated than this....but...... your chemistry teacher probably wants you to assume that the acetate ion will take hydrogen ions away from water, leaving hydroxide.  In effect, that would create the same pH as a 0.4M solution of sodium hydroxide, for example.	1	3
What is the pH of a 0.4 M solution of CH3COONa?	Stick some Litmus paper in the solution then you'll find out.	1	3
Why does Christianity teach...?	Don't forget that all homosexuals are devil-worshiping demons who shall be condemned to the bowels of hell. The whole concept of organized religion is so RIDICULOUS, that you just gotta laugh.	1	4
Why does Christianity teach...?	"Really Christianity teaches that?  I am very surprised.  . Yes you will burn in hell if you don't love him back.  Is that so hard to believe? Why is it so tough to believe?. Don't you see hell around you nowadays.  I'll give you a good hint...Open your news paper and see how many people have died today of gunshot wounds.   Ask individuals who suffered from the World Trade Center attacks, what it felt like during that time.  I'm sure none of them will tell you ""I was really happy, and it felt great yipeeee"".  They will probably tell you that they were in HELL! . . I don't believe Christianity teaches that sex is the most awful, filthy thing on earth and you should save it for someone you love.  Where in Christianity does it teach that?  Did you hear that in church or did you hear that from the mouth of Christ?"	1	4
Why does Christianity teach...?	I can't speak for all of Christianity, but my church doesn't teach me this.. . The Church and the Bible does not teach that sex is vile, what it teaches is the sanctity of marriage, which in itself is the continuation of life.  Marriage was not always about love, rather about property and children.  Many marriages were arranged between families to enrich ones land or blood line.  Many royal families married other royalty to form alliances.  The church teaches sex should be within the confines of marriage, to protect the souls of those who are created out of the act.  Sex in this instance is an act of god.  Love is an entirely different entity.  Love is a human emotion not bounded by the dogma of christianity, nor controlled by it. . . As to the concept of heaven/hell, this can be traced throughout time.  Dante's Inferno is a great example of this.  The ancients believed in one place for both heaven and hell with different tiers to determine you eternal place...from the Elysian Fields of bliss to the torment souls who were forced to perform tasks until the end of time.  The most recent christian formation of hell can be traced back to the Spanish Inquistion and the rise of the anglican church in Europe.  . . In short, no this does not mean you can only have sex with god; but you should think about your actions and who will be hurt when you have sex.	1	4
Why does Christianity teach...?	Religion as a whole teaches you just to believe what people tell you and never question it!	0	2
Why does Christianity teach...?	Do you often make statements on beliefs and topics that you have very little knowledge of?  Do you feel superior by belittling someone else's belief?  Try reading the bible, with a open mind, and heart.  It may speak to you, you may have to actually change your life, you may have to love someone above yourself, so if you want to quote the work and Word of God, maybe just maybe reading it first would help you look less ignorant.. . Wow, let me see if I can take anything else in this sad world out of context, or written in another language and use it to misinform people.  Mr Slambango-try reading the verses directly before and after the ones you quote, try learning what the culturistic meaning would be by these sayings and events, of you tried actually studying who Jesus was and what it meant in the first scripture you quote, you would know why you sound so silly to anyone who does know Jesus as Savior.  You are actually telling the very reason being a Christian means having to let go of unbelievers sometimes, especially ones whose hearts are hardened.  It also is later referring to why I won't tell you that you are an idiot, slanderer, moronic or anything like that, Jesus came to fight my battle and guess what?  I win.. . Martin-you are such a better witness than I, thanks for the uplifting!	1	3
Why does Christianity teach...?	"Actually, I don't think that Christianity teaches that sex is only for ""someone you love"".. . Back in that time, sex/marriage wasn't about love, as much as it was about reporduction and having kids to carry on your name (or if poor, then to do the hard work when you die)."	1	3
Why does Christianity teach...?	the bible does not say that if you don't love god you will burn in hell. It also doesn't say that sex is filthy. Sex is an important, sacred and precious thing and should be shared with someone special.	1	4
Why does Christianity teach...?	Whatever God teaches is for our own good, look at what happens when you have sex with many people you don't love.	0	2
Why does Christianity teach...?	"1. If you choose to live all of your life saying ""I don't need God!"" then He will honor that choice when your life ends. Hell is defined as being separated from God's presence.. . 2. The Bible says this about sex:. . Song of Solomon 4:3  Thy lips are like a thread of scarlet, and thy speech is comely: thy temples are like a piece of a pomegranate within thy locks.  (4)  Thy neck is like the tower of David builded for an armoury, whereon there hang a thousand bucklers, all shields of mighty men.  (5)  Thy two breasts are like two young roes that are twins, which feed among the lilies.  (6)  Until the day break, and the shadows flee away, I will get me to the mountain of myrrh, and to the hill of frankincense.  (7)  Thou art all fair, my love; there is no spot in thee.  (8)  Come with me from Lebanon, my spouse, with me from Lebanon: look from the top of Amana, from the top of Shenir and Hermon, from the lions' dens, from the mountains of the leopards.. . Proverbs 5:18  Let thy fountain be blessed: and rejoice with the wife of thy youth.  (19)  Let her be as the loving hind and pleasant roe; let her breasts satisfy thee at all times; and be thou ravished always with her love.. . 1 Corinthians 7:3  Let the husband render to his wife the affection due her, and likewise also the wife to her husband.  (4)  The wife does not have authority over her own body, but the husband does. And likewise the husband does not have authority over his own body, but the wife does.  (5)  Do not deprive one another, except by mutual agreement, and that for a season, so that you may devote yourselves to fasting and prayer; and come together again, lest Satan tempt you because of your lack of self-control.. . and lastly...Hebrews 13:4  Marriage is honorable among all, and the bed undefiled; but fornicators and adulterers God will judge."	0	2
Why does Christianity teach...?	Christ has never said these things .. it's the creation of church !!	1	3
Why does Christianity teach...?	Who have you been listening to?. Your question is full of fallacy.. You are just here to make statements and to critisize.. Do yourself a favor and gain a little knowledge before you open you mouth and remove all doubt.	0	2
Why does Christianity teach...?	"Sex is not ""awful and filthy"" as you say. We teach it is a wonderful thing created by God to be enjoyed by two persons within the bounds of matrimony. . . You have a choice eternity with God or separated from him.. . Choose you this day who you will serve."	1	3
Why does Christianity teach...?	I guess I am going to burn in hell, then.... I do love myself, is that ok?	0	2
Why does Christianity teach...?	"Oh here's some good stuff for ya... . . . ""There be eunuchs, which have made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven's sake. He that is able to receive it, let him receive it."" Dangerous words from a guy who recommends cutting of body parts if they cause you to sin (Mt.5:29-30, Mt.18:8-9, Mk.9:43-48). It might make someone castrate himself so that he could be one of the 144,000 male virgins, who alone will make it to heaven (Rev.14:3-4). Matt 19:12 . . One of the followers of Jesus was a young, nearly naked man who dropped his linen cloth and ""fled from them naked"" when the priests came to arrest Jesus. Mark 14:51-52 . . In Romans, Paul explains that ""the natural use"" of women is to act as sexual objects for the pleasure of men. Rom 1:27 . Christianity teaches you to hate your entire family (Luke 14:26 KJV) . . On a lighter note.... . Jesus says that he has come to destroy families by making family members hate each other. He has ""come not to send peace, but a sword."" Matt 10:34-36 . . God said Abandon your wife and children for Jesus and he'll give you a big reward. Matt 19:29. . Jesus criticizes the Jews for not killing their disobedient children as required by Old Testament law. Mark 7:9-10 . . Jesus won't even let his followers bury their dead parents or say farewell to their families before abandoning them. Mark 9:59-62 . . Jesus recommends that to avoid sin we cut off our hands and pluck out our eyes. This advice is given immediately after he says that anyone who looks with lust at any women commits adultery. Matt 5:29-30 . . Jesus says that we should fear God since he has the power to kill us and then torture us forever in hell. Luke 12:5"	1	4
Why does Christianity teach...?	If you want a serious answer to these questions, email me in the subject line put God. I don't open mail from unknown recipiants. lovemuffin4551@yahoo.com	0	2
Why does Christianity teach...?	"Correction.  That's not what the Bible says.  That's what ""Christians"" say.  The message of God's love is quite a different story.  Christians know this to be true and live the message of the Bible.  ""Christians"" need to stop being a part of the problem suggetsed by this question."	0	2
Why does Christianity teach...?	What it happens is that God, the Almighty, is the beginning and the End of the Creation. But you have free will and if you choose to reject God, you only choose your final, and this rejection has not need to be explicit, it's like a father that has a rebel teenager that reject's everything the old man try to teach him, if the teenager grows and learn from his errors then he will say 'my old dad was right', and his miscarriage will be forgiven, but if he lost himself, and he end in jail, the father has nothing to do about.. . Sex is something that has to be taken with responsibility,. written is in Genesis 2,24. . Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh. . . When sex has love and responsibility is wonderful, in another way is miscarriage, this has nothing to do with the bible, but with ethics.	1	3
Why does Christianity teach...?	Your wrong. God loves you so much He gives you the choice to love Him or not. He could have made us slaves to him, but forced love is not true love, so He gave us a free will. All He wants is for us to love Him. He loved you so much He sacrificed His only son so we could be forgiven of our sins. It is sin that separates us from God, and also sin that gets us a ticket to hell. Therefore, if we chose to sin, then we chose to go to hell. God does not send us to hell, we do!.  Also, sex is a gift from God to husband and wife. We are the ones who make it dirty by fornication and promiscuity. If you don't believe me, think of it this way, sex in a monogamous relationship, ie husband and wife, rarely has bad problems, where as sex with different people over time is an extreme health risk with disease as well as unwanted pregnancy. As you can see, sex out of wedlock is a sin not because God doesn't want you to have fun or feel pleasure, but to keep you from getting Aids or having to get an abortion. Marriage is OK, you can have all the sex and pleasure you want.	1	4
Why does Christianity teach...?	"Control. You can answer just about any ""why"" question about religion with the answer - CONTROL..  The only reason religion exists is to control people. To force them to do The Church's will - not God's will - thus allowing The Church to continue what is has been doing all these years, which is controlling others for It's own gain."	1	3
Why does Christianity teach...?	go figure - love god or bur in hell.. . who thought up this crap?  It was a way for the rich elite of the time to control the masses - no more, no less.	0	2
Why does Christianity teach...?	We are told to make desciples, by Jesus.. How else would you do that without 'teaching'?. Did you learn numbers by looking at them? Or did someone show you how to use them?. When you learned how to speak...Da-Da,   Ma, Ma,   Goooh. . Get it?	1	3
Why does Christianity teach...?	God is love.  He loves all, but cannot be in the presence of sin.  rather, sin cannot be in His presence.  if one was to enter His presence in eternity with sin in their heart, the torture would be far greater than that of hell.  hell was made for those who rebel against God.  not for people.  . . you've never read the song of songs have you?  any church that reads the Bible can tell you that sex is the most beautiful thing on earth, but is only protected under the sanctity of marriage.  its like fire: use it right and it is awesome.  use it wrong and it can be fatal.	1	4
Why does Christianity teach...?	First of all God loves you and if you dont accept Him yes you will end up in hell. God does not desire that for you He has made a way you dont have to burn just have to accept that gift. . And sex is not filthy if it is shared with the one you marry. God designed sex to be shared with your wife/husband.	0	2
Why does Christianity teach...?	"First of all- God wants respect; and how could He not. He created us all and everything around us... why should loyaly humans deny this.... . Second- sex is not taught to be ""the most awful, filthy thing on earth"" if that's what was taught- why would they tell people to save some filthy for someone they love? Sex is merely for reproduction (and if you find pleasure out of it that's fine- but the main goal of sex IS reproduction) . . And No- God neither has nor needs sex.. . God Bless"	0	2
How can we solve a problem?	to solve a problem you need the correct formula, just like with math, if you don't have the proper formula you will never get a solution, and just like with math different problems have different formulas.

How can we solve a problem?	i am of the opinion that if it is nothing important, then we can just simply solve it on our own. of course, gaining an expert's point of view would probably be valuable in helping you to solve your problem and that is why they are often consulted. just try to think of the problem from different angles, aspects, and point of views. explore every option possible and walk in someone else's shoes.. . hope that helped (:	1	4

How can we solve a problem?	depends upon nature of problem............ it the matter can affect other also then always consult....... if it is related to you only then solve it yourself.	1	4
How can we solve a problem?	Don't consult an expert. They are not intersested in you, only your money!	1	3
How can we solve a problem?	You are always your own primary care giver.  However nobody knows everything (not even a megalomaniac).  . . Use experts but don't rely on them.  What I mean by that is get information from experts but filter it through your own knowledge and experience.  . . Use the information but don't trust blindly.  Experts are people; some will help, some are in it for themselves and some will make mistakes.  . . Asking good questions, questioning the answers and then deciding for yourself is the best formula.	1	4
how is light energy turned into heat energy?	By capturing the light and storing it.. For example capturing the sunlight inside the glass chambers filled with special metal foils that will get heated and then can be used later in solar energy.. So, that we can use that energy to heat, light, cook, and many other things.	1	4
how is light energy turned into heat energy?	Not all light can generate heat. Only the Infrared spectrum does that...will happen when infrared is absorbed by a surface, such as a flat black covering...noticable heat will accumulate quickly.	1	4
how is light energy turned into heat energy?	By being absorbed by matter. Remember, infrared radiation is also light.	1	4
how is light energy turned into heat energy?	When some atoms are struck by visible light, they release energy back at a lower energy level or infrared radiation which we feel as heat.  So it's all the same kind of energy, just intensity changing.	1	4
how is light energy turned into heat energy?	"Absorption of infrared radiation causes a temperature increase in the surface of the item in question.  The heating effect is usually uneven and spreads from the side facing the source of infrared radiation to the opposite side.  Some materials absorb IR more readily than others, hence the so-called ""greenhouse effect"".  The glass of the greenhouse absorbs little of the IR directed at it but the interior heats quite effectively in full sunlight.  Hope that helps."	1	4
how is light energy turned into heat energy?	When light flux collide with the atoms in your body for example:your have an effect called the Compton effect.. Light radiation of the flux arrives a certain frequencies at collison with atoms and the recoil is as follows;. some of the power is absorbed in your body's atoms . at a particular frequency .(  absorption). . The remainder of the flux is heat and light at different frequencies gets bounced back . There is it reflected back but with lesser power. The  change of direction of the flux would be called refraction.(bending of light) . . The original power of the radiation is the sum of the  reflection and refraction and absorption power.. . The absorption power is radiation at a certain frequency which we call heat.	1	4
how is light energy turned into heat energy?	Here's another way:  plants use light energy to grow, so some of it is stored in their molecules.  The plants die and some of them are eventually turned into fossil fuels.  Man comes along, harvests the fuel, and turns some of it into heating oil.  The oil is burned, producing heat.	1	4

Why are liberals incapable of identifying and confronting evil?	Liberals are known as being opportunists. They look to gain from others missteps or misfortunes.

Why are liberals incapable of identifying and confronting evil?	and what have conservatives done? besides cause the world to hate the united states, France at least isn't invading countries under the lie of false democracy.You can call it liberation, but to me it seems more like setting up puppet regimes that will kiss bushes ass like tony blair and do what he says(like republicans give a shit about people in darfur? lol their just warmongers that masturbate ww2 battles on the history channel)	0	1

Why are liberals incapable of identifying and confronting evil?	There are many evil, or what Americans consider evil, leaders in this world.The reality is that unless it happens in our country we have no right to judge other leaders. IF we had destroyed Ahfganistan to kill Osama eveyone in this country would be on the same side. The problem is we invaded a soverign country who had NOTHING to do with 9/11. The hijackers were Saudis, Osama is a Saudi. Did we go into Saudi Arabia. No. Why ?Because Bush has many oil deals with them. We went after Iraqi oil not the real terrorists. Liberals are not incapable of confronting evil, we just want it to be sure that it is the real evil.	1	4
Why are liberals incapable of identifying and confronting evil?	"I think that the liberal left has a legitimate phyco impediment.  Their own lives are routine and boring, so they feel that they have to jump to create better lives for the miss fortunate of this, and other countries...

They have a theory that nothing is anyone's fault, and yet everything is someone else's fault. Doesn't make sense does it?. . Ignore them, they lost the ability to win the presidency and are spinning farther and farther away from the mainstream."	1	3

Why are liberals incapable of identifying and confronting evil?	"Its just politics. Liberals have in the past denounced Saddam, N Korea, etc - but today - they are incapable of claiming anything is evil, for it would agree with Bush, Reps and cons alike. . . They look at public perceptino, then make a decision after they have poured over that perception. Immediately after 9/11 - every Dem Senator and liberal made grandiose soap box statements  concerning ""evil"" - because the American public required it. Now, that the sentiments are largely against Iraq - they have switched gears and denounce anything ""evil"""	1	4
Why are liberals incapable of identifying and confronting evil?	"I think a NINE TRILLION DOLLAR national debt, including the 3 largest annual budget deficits (all authored by Bush and his lackies in Congress) is pretty evil. Why can't the so-called ""conservatives"" of the Republican Party manage a balanced budget like Clinton did? The best they could do was vote recently to raise the ceiling on the national debt.. . ps: NINE TRILLION DOLLARS equals $30,000 apiece for each American."	1	4

Why are liberals incapable of identifying and confronting evil?	"No one denies that Saddam Hussein was a monster. However, the ""War on Terror"" was supposed to be a response to the 9/11 attacks. And in case you've forgotten, it was Osama bin Laden, not Saddam Hussein, who was responsible for the attacks. By the way, where the hell is Osama bin Laden? It's been nearly 5 years since the 9/11 attacks, and he STILL hasn't been caught! When is his evil going to be confronted?. . By the way, we are the United States of America, not the World Police.

Why are liberals incapable of identifying and confronting evil?	"The answer to your question is a condition I term ""logic dyslexia"", liberals see the same thing we see but their minds turn it around and reverse what is obvious. Either I am right about this theory or they are just plain liars and so bend on their hatred of Bush for beating Gore and Kerry that no matter what truth they hear they deny or claim they disbelieve it. I am just glad I am not a twisted minded liberal who has to argue their unsupported point of view.. America isn't the enemy, beleive that, this country has given too much blood for freedom of millions in the past and those who will inherit freedom in the future, believe in America and be united for truth, democracy and personal rights and freedom, don't be a coward like the democrats."	0	2
Why are liberals incapable of identifying and confronting evil?	"I agree-the US needs to step in and help the poor people in the Sudan and Darfur. That we have not done so is a crime. But what problem do you have with France?  You sound just like one of my close relatives! Actually, as one who is fairly liberal I don't have a problem recognizing evil-in myself or in others. Its present everywhere, just as good is.  Its just that I  rarely confront it  because its a ""live and let live"" world for me. I would  step in to report an accident or a crime being committed.  And  when I recognize ongoing abuse I do try to help. Trouble there is that many caught up in abusive situations don't want  help. I don't hate Bush; I just think he's a nasty,  limited little man, drunk with power as many of ALL political persuasions are. I do vote and express myself in that way.  So many things are beyond my immediate control. So what I do on a daily basis is just to try and bring a little something positive to life by not causing harm or pain to myself or others. Blaming and finger pointing  does nothing  but  cause more problems. And the world doesn't need more problems."	0	2

I guess they were liberted.  From life.. . Who has France liberted exactly?  . . Well, if I recall they were a very big help in liberating the American colonist from British rule.  History books indicated that if it had not been for the French, the Americans would not have won their Independence."	1	4
Why are liberals incapable of identifying and confronting evil?	Where ever you are getting your facts, you need to evaluate your sources. How is our war in Iraq related to Bin Laden.

"why is there chinese chartacters but then you can spell them out in english i.e ,"" wei, Ni how ma"" VS the"	The characters are part of their culture. Why should they change just to make it easier on westerners?	1	3
"why is there chinese chartacters but then you can spell them out in english i.e ,"" wei, Ni how ma"" VS the"	from what I've learned, for China to better industrialize and join the rest of the world, they had to alter their language because other countries didn't have the capability to print Chinese characters. You speak of pinyin. Pinyin uses the normal letters we use everyday so it can be printed by most all presses and computers.	1	4
"why is there chinese chartacters but then you can spell them out in english i.e ,"" wei, Ni how ma"" VS the"	I dont don't believe most of u said to help people learn the language!. . Think about the world of computers!!. . You going to have a keyboard with over 10000 keys?. . Pinyin has become a necessity due to computers. You input pinyin and the computer converts it into a character.. You can tell who uses a computer or SMS's alot just buy who can spell pinyin well and who cant.	1	3
"why is there chinese chartacters but then you can spell them out in english i.e ,"" wei, Ni how ma"" VS the"	Its called Hanyi Pinying.. . Its the Olden Chinese way of saying.. In wei,NI how ma means HEy, How are you.. . Its from the Hanyi piying we have 4 differnet pronouncation.. the first 1 is - 2nd / 3rd v and fourth &#92;. . this mainly use for talking and how deep the sounds go amkes the word come out different.In Chinese there might me up to 100 words of the same gerneral way of saying it as Ni.. But actually there is Ni. Ne. niii. NI. . there as a form there can be 4 ways,. . Get the picture?	1	4
"why is there chinese chartacters but then you can spell them out in english i.e ,"" wei, Ni how ma"" VS the"	This is just romanised Chinese to help the English-speaking people communicate with the Chinese. However, Chinese language is tonal so wrong intonation will give a different meaning. So romanised Chinese helps make the Chinese world go round. Otherwise, all non-Chinese will have problem in dealing with Chinese.	1	4
"why is there chinese chartacters but then you can spell them out in english i.e ,"" wei, Ni how ma"" VS the"	The original Chinese characters are just that, char actors or pictures. Over time, they've become their written language and the pictures are harder to see.  Because of the western world, words have been phonetically written, mainly to help foreigners learn the language.. . I hope this helps, I'm not real good at explaining things.	1	4
"why is there chinese chartacters but then you can spell them out in english i.e ,"" wei, Ni how ma"" VS the"	To help differentiate between all the words. If you don't know the character, you will have to use these to remember how they sound like.	1	4
"why is there chinese chartacters but then you can spell them out in english i.e ,"" wei, Ni how ma"" VS the"	"spelling the pronounciation of chinese words using roman characters might be useful for those who want to study chinese language such as mandarin,hokkien,cantonese and others.chinese characters are very hard to learn,read and  write.. . Some chinese speak chinese,but they don't know how to write the characters.say you want to copy a chinese character,you probably wont succeed/your writing would be really ugly.writing chinese characters is considered some sort of art.. . plus,each characters are meant for each meanings.exm: the word ""si/se"".it can mean die or number 4. that's why the chinese characters exist to differenciate between these two.and eventhough the word ""si/se"" is the same,the chinese pronounce them slightly differently,depending on the meanings."	1	3
"why is there chinese chartacters but then you can spell them out in english i.e ,"" wei, Ni how ma"" VS the"	"Chinese characters is the proper way of writing Chinese. . . English spelling is to help people pronounce the chinese characters properly.. Writing just ""wei"" is not complete, there are 4 pronounciation of ""wei"" in chinese. We put symbols above AEIOU to determine the pronounciation of the word.  _. wei wĕi wéi wèi. . wei, ni hao ma = hello, how are you"	1	4

Why do people have two nostrils?	Because the major sense organs of vertebrates (smell, hearing/balance, and sight) are paired; we are bilateral animals. The embryo starts with two olfactive capsules at its front end, which develop according to the species, but are usually separated by a septum that represents the contact between both capsules. Even dolphins, although they appear to have one nostril (the hole on top  of their heads) have two channels separated by a septum, and only the external opening is single.	1	4
Why do people have two nostrils?	Typically, one nostril is slightly wet and congested while the other allows air to flow freely. Odors are carried by small and large particles. We smell odors when the particles disolve into the wet membranes inside the nostrils. The small particles are smelled by the free flowing nostril in which air moves quickly and spreads lots of small particles over a large area. The large particles are smelled by the wetter more congested nostril in which the large particles disolve slowly but completely in the wetter membranes.	1	4

why u.s is trying 2 help israel  so what about palastene israel has more weapons than palastene?	"A short allegory of Israel:. . Pretend that Israel is an apartment building.. . Some jews live there, some Arabs (Jordanians). Many empty nasty apartments.. . The Health Department says you Jews need a place to live. Take these places, fix them up, live here.. . Tired Jews move into vacant apartments, in spite of the hatred and attacks and murders by the Arabs (Jordanians).. Them fix up the apartments, live quietly, and protect themselves.. . Health Department comes by and says, good job, you can keep the apartments and the building itself.. . Jews now own the building. Arabs (Jordanians) say ""Oh my God, they will murder and kill and rob and rape us simply because we murdered and killed and robbed and raped them, how unfair!!"". . Arabs (Jordanians) run away leaving vacant apartments.. . Abandoned apartments become property of the landlords (Jews) and are turned over to other settlers who move in.. . Arabs (Jordanians) go to all other Arab countries and whine about reparations and poverty. Other Arab Countries kick them out.. . Arabs (Jordanians) decide that they need a new image.. . ""Hey!!!

why u.s is trying 2 help israel  so what about palastene israel has more weapons than palastene?	As you know, the U S today has a lot of Religious fundamentalists among it's leaders. These ratbags believe in Biblical Prophesy. They also believe that the Israelites are God's chosen people and therefore can do no wrong. So the U S not only lets Israel literally get away with murder, it offers financial and technological aid in order to 'bring on' the prophesied 'end times'.	1	3
why u.s is trying 2 help israel  so what about palastene israel has more weapons than palastene?	I believe that the Palestinians are cornered by Isreal in every possible way, that their economic and social well being is threatened by a Political regime with extremely powerful military support.  Having said that though, I feel Israel has the right to exist as a nation and that the Palestinian authority has to come to terms with that.  In what way are the many surrounding Arab countries helping Palestine, besides always pledging solutions in their Pan-Arab summits and not commiting to them.  Where are they in this equation?  I do understand your position though.	1	4
why u.s is trying 2 help israel  so what about palastene israel has more weapons than palastene?	I guess two things - the relgious influence from US that believes Israel can do no wrong and the fact that Israel is their key friend in the middle East. So Palestine gets ignored and what is happening to her people not publicised as it may make the people in US question what is going on there...(media manipulation of attitudes)	0	2
why u.s is trying 2 help israel  so what about palastene israel has more weapons than palastene?	The answer to your question may very well be that there is no answer.  The United States considers Israel to be an ally. Israel is a westen style democracy with close ties to the U.S.  The problem lies in the fact that the Palestinans have been goverened by what the U.S. considers to be terrorist organizations, first the PLO, and now Hamas.  While we agree that a solution to the abject poverty and social problems of the Palestinans needs to be found, we are not willing to do it when these same organizations blow up buses and cafes and kill innocent people.  There are those who will argue that Israel does the same thing when they encroach onto Palestinian territory.  The government of the U.S. considers that to be Israel defending itself.  Currently you have a new government in Israel and a new government in Palestine.  The two governments will not have relations of any sort until Hammas agrees to renounce its stated position of the destruction of Israel.  Because of this position and prior terrorist activities, most western nations have cut aid to the Palestinian government.  As far as Israel having alot of weapons, that is because if you look at the map you will see that they live in a very rough part of the owrld, not only do you have the Palestinian government calling for the destruction of Israel, you also have Iran calling for its destruction.  Israel has to remain well armed and tough to survive.  I am sure that thee are those who will disagree with much of what I said, as I stated in the beginning, there very well maynot be an answer to your question.	1	4
why u.s is trying 2 help israel  so what about palastene israel has more weapons than palastene?	Is this a serious question? Israel has been an ally of the US since its birth; Palestine has long been a breeding ground for dissent and violent extremists. Some say that a terrorist is a freedom fighter depending on what side you are on, and I won't get into that debate; but you must question the motives of tose who use fear and terror to get their point across...civil disobedience cowed the British Empire, and ended segregation in the US...do innocent people have to die to prove a point?	1	3

can I feed my red eared slider steak?	Red eared sliders and other aquatic turtles like to eat in the water. Vegetables, fruits, and greens should be cut or shredded into bite sized pieces and placed in the water. Likewise, meat items can be cut into bite sized pieces if necessary, but many feeder insects and fish can simply placed in the water. . As you can imagine, simply placing the food in the water can get messy. A great way to avoid messing up the tank and avoiding the problem of food spoilage affecting water quality is to simply feed in a separate container. Many owners keep a simple plastic tub just for this purpose. Just put the turtle in the feeding tub, and then when it is done eating place the turtle back in its regular tank. This is a great way to monitor exactly what your turtle eats and if you have more than one turtle you can make sure each is getting a variety of items and a sufficient amount to eat.	1	3

why do husky's have coloful eyes then other dogs?	Siberians are allowed to have any color eyes, because eye color has/had nothing to do with their original function (endurance sled dog). Thus, people never selected for eye color when choosing which dogs to breed, and a number of eye colors became prominent in the gene pool.. . This is the same reason Siberians have so many different coat colors/patterns. When specific color genes aren't emphasized, you get a genetic range.	1	4

why do they say dont keep eggs in the fridge if there is a special compartment in most fridges for eggs?	"Actually what ""they"" say is not to keeps eggs in the DOOR of the fridge. The reasoning behind this is that the door is actually the warmest part of the fridge since its the farthest from the cooling mechanism and also, every time the door opens the temperature fluctuates even further, so you cannot be assured that the eggs are being kept at a constant temperature to prevent salmonella or something. As far as why there are egg compartments in the doors, that's just something that Fridge maufacturers added for convenience to sell more fridges, personally I keep my eggs in the bottom of the fridge in their original packaging."	1	4

"I don't know who the ""they"" are that you're refering to, but the Food and Drug Administration says that eggs should be refrigerated and that they keep for 6 weeks IF refrigerated.  What that person or people may be refering to is that it is not recomended to put the eggs in the compartment that you refered to as they will go bad more quickly. It is better for the eggs to leave them in the carton that they were purchased in - in the refrigerator."	1	4
why do they say dont keep eggs in the fridge if there is a special compartment in most fridges for eggs?	I have never heard anyone say that, and I am over 40.  In fact, when I did a web search, the web sites said not to keep them out of the refrigerator.	1	3
why do they say dont keep eggs in the fridge if there is a special compartment in most fridges for eggs?	Perhaps what you heard was to not store them in the egg compartment in the fridge?. . Safety experts are recommending that egg be left in their original packaging and stored in the refrigerator, as opposed to storing them in the egg tray that used to come with fridges.  I think the basic reason is that egg cartons are designed for optimal egg storage.	1	4
how/do tarot cards work?	you must know how to read people and then you use the cards to guide you in the reading but I good reading is done with talent in reading and feeling the person.  I do this and people are amazed when they hear it because they do not think it is real.  It is not to be used to guide your life like a religion but there are many people who have gifts of reading people and feeling things..I have told people over the Internet that they were going to have a baby soon and things that were going on in their life and did not know anything about them..just to show them that it is real but if tested, I usually decline because I do not like when people challenge me..

how/do tarot cards work?	"Two different ways:. . 1) by giving a manipulative person a chance to ""read"" someone and push their buttons / pull their strings. 2) by giving an open person a chance to see what's moving them, what's in play, what's going on.. . What makes us think whatever we're thinking? Sure, we'd have thoughts even if /nothing/ was happening ... memories, questions, worries, all of that. But normally we're in an active environment, yes?. . So when we take control of what we're responding to we can have a strong effect on what we think. Colours, shapes, all of that. Pictures have a strong effect on us because they combine all of that.. . So, using shapes and colours and including symbols (which bring up whole groups of associations) we can have a strong effect on what ""comes to mind"".. . By giving meaning to different card positions (past and future; what you hope for and what you fear) we can construct a story.. . What I like to notice is what the person really agrees with or disagrees with in the reading ... those are the items that mean the most. Or this: sometimes someone will be almost blind to something ... that's meaningful too!. . But don't worry about this sorta thing ... they're just ways to get us to think a bit!. :-)"	0	2

Because his soft pallet muscles became tired they would collapse causing him to stop breathing.

How to stop rabbit from peeing on the floor?	They are conditioned to use one particular area.  The wild ones do this in their den so that they don't have excrement all over the place.  I don't see you teaching it to do it any other way.. . Your best bet would be to modify the cage-add Plexiglas or something to the outside to keep the urine from spraying out.	1	4
How to stop rabbit from peeing on the floor?	Well, not really. I'm just confused as to why you would think cleaning a grated cage is better than having a litter-trained bunny. Grated cages are actually bad for rabbits. It's bad for their hocks and they can get their feet stuck in the grates. This could cause injury if they try to get themselves out.  . . This was listed on House Rabbit Society's website:. Is it OK to keep my rabbit in a cage with a wire floor?. Rabbits were not designed to live on wire floors--they're hard on their feet (which have no pads on the, like cats or dogs). If you must use a cage with a wire floor, you need to provide your rabbit with a resting board or rug for her to sit on, otherwise she will spend all of her time in her litterbox. . You can find cages with slatted plastic floors, which are more comfortable, or you can use a solid floor. As long as your rabbit has a litterbox in the corner that he chooses as his bathroom, there shouldn't be much of a mess to clean up.. . . Once a bunny is trained, their trained.  He's going to go to that corner to pee everytime and you really can't stop it. My advice; see the grated cage and go back to one w/ a floor and a corner litter box.. . For more info on cages and litter training, go to http://www.rabbit.org/faq/sections/housing.html. http://www.rabbit.org/faq/sections/litter.html	1	4
How to stop rabbit from peeing on the floor?	i had an angora rabbit i housebroke it with a litter box. .     they are like cats that way.....	1	4
How to stop rabbit from peeing on the floor?	You might have to move the litterbox back in, just for the meantime. Put it back in his spot, and then gradually move it so he's going somehwere else. Pretty soon THAT will be his spot so when you remove the litterbox to the grate he'll go there. It might take time - but it'll be worth it in the end not to have your floor all yucky. Good luck!	1	4
How to stop rabbit from peeing on the floor?	the rabbit is used to going in a litter box you need to give it back.	0	2
How to stop rabbit from peeing on the floor?	once litter trained always litter trained. My rabbit doesn't like it when you move anything in his cage. he'll move it back.  Really!!!	0	2
How to stop rabbit from peeing on the floor?	punch it.............or just stick its face in the pee and teach it not to pee there	1	3
How to stop rabbit from peeing on the floor?	Animals remember where to pee by sniffing for where they last peed. . The idea is to smear its urine somewhere u want it to pee, while keeping other areas absolutely urine free. After 1 week, it should get the message.	1	3

How to stop rabbit from peeing on the floor?	I'm afraid that you're not going to be able to change anything. He was litterbox trained, and, to him, that's that. Rabbits are super clean animals, and instinclively use only selected spaces to use as a bathroom.I strongly suggest putting the litterbox back, no matter how much of a hassle it was (isn't what you're going through more of a hassle???).. By the way, rabbits should NOT have grated cages... it's really horrible for their feet, as they don't have pads to protect them.	1	4

How to stop rabbit from peeing on the floor?	Litter boxes are really the best option. However they make cage guards that you can lock onto the wall of the cage to prevent too much spraying. Also is your rabbit fixed? This will help with spraying.	1	4
How to stop rabbit from peeing on the floor?	Don't put them on the floor. Rabbits are always going to be semi-wild animals and never train completely. You got the animal into the habit of going in one spot, so they'll continue to do so.. . My suggestion, go back to the litter box. You got the animal, and you have to accept the responsibilities, no matter how disgusting, and take care of it.	1	4
How to stop rabbit from peeing on the floor?	Rabbits are very habitual. He is used to peeing in that spot and has been doing it for a very long time. That is HIS spot just like the toilet is your spot.. Keep redirecting him but he may never learn other than what he already knows.	1	4
How to stop rabbit from peeing on the floor?	Just construct a shield in his favorite pee corner so that it doesn't get all over the all and floor.   There is no way to stop him.  rabbits are relatively clean animals and therefore really don't like living in their own urine.	1	4
why do some animals always have more than one baby & some animals don't?	depends on how high up the food chain they are. the lower they are on the food chain, the more offspring they tend to have, not only because they are meant to feed other animals, but also in the likelihood of the continuation of their species	1	4
why do some animals always have more than one baby & some animals don't?	The amount of babies a species has is directly related to the need for survival of the species. Fish lay thousands of eggs because the vast majority will be eaten as eggs, young or adult. Some will survive and the species will continue. Others, like humans have typically one baby because the baby needs a lot of care to survive. It is only in recent history that humans have had so much abundance that most children survive.	1	4

why do we find bricks in toilets?	For particular community people (for gents), they need brick after urinating. This is the truth and I am not jocking.	1	4
why do we find bricks in toilets?	Hopefully it's in the toilet tank and not the bowl.. . It has to do with replacing water that would take the same place as the brick.  So that's the water that you save, maybe 16 oz.. . By the way sometimes you have to flush twice when something big needs to go down.. . What I do, is I ditched the regular toilet and bought an Eco friendly toilet that's pressurized.  It uses less water too and stuff goes the heck down!	1	4
why do we find bricks in toilets?	It was a helpful hint started back during the height of the energy crisis days.  The brick in the tank brings the water level up thus using less water to flush the commode.  It's actually a very helpful hint and will help you save on your water bill.	1	4
why do we find bricks in toilets?	To save on water consumption. The brick takes up space. and then the toilet uses less water.	1	4

why do we find bricks in toilets?	Hi first of all I'd like to tell u people to understand the question. The person asked why we find bricks in toilets (not in tanks). But, many of gave thinking of tanks. Yes, certain community (as one of our friend referred). I'll specify Muslims as far as I know, use the bricks after urination let it be in toilets or any public places. I've seen my friends searching for small pieces of brick while urinating in public places. They just touch the brick on the tip of the cock. I don't know why they do. Cos, I never asked them and I am not intrested in it at all.	1	4
why do we find bricks in toilets?	Nupakry is right some communities use this to dry up after urination.. Scientifically & Historically it was used in the deserts where water was scarce and infections were an issue with the hot weather. So people cleaned up after peeing. As to why this is still followed today totally baffles me now??? Probably an issue again of mixing a totally logical procedure with religion!	1	4
why do we find bricks in toilets?	Well certain community gents after urinating use brick pieces to absorb the last drops of urine so that they do not come in touch with their body... which is considered impure !!!!!	1	3
why do we find bricks in toilets?	they allow the tank to fill up with less water, thus using less water and more environmentally friendly.	1	4

I doubt it, and your attempt at arguement is off the wall. And what the heck are you talking about Day 5/Day 6...do you really believe that the Earth was created in 7 literal days???? Gee, you have a great ability to turn a blind eye to knowledge. Must be wonderful.	1	4

If God talked to Moses why didn't God explain to Moses about evolution, why all the day 5 day 6 lies?	My question precisely... in other words... why make things more complicated than they are and therefore harder to understand? Surely an almighty being would have known how to explain his devices to ancient humans simply. Surely if they could handle talking snakes, they could handle a little science lesson.  . . Why would God be so cryptic, knowing that years down the road, people would be led away from him by it? Why say that the earth was created before the stars, when in fact, the stars are older than the earth?. .

how do I get rid of a bird's nest @ my kichen window?	Couple ideas come to mind:. - tape some aluminum to the window, the shiny material may scare off the birds. - nail some spikes, assuming the nest is at the window ledge, onto the window frame, it'll make the birds uncomfortable - this isn't cruel, just a common and old approach - alternative is to nail some chicken wire. - tape a picture of an owl, I'm not kidding, onto your window, move it every couple days. - mount an owl nearby, again, move it around every couple of days. - the hard way is to knock down the nest - but once there is cheeping and chirping, knocking it down is a decision you'll need to make on your own. .

If a coin is tossed twice, what is the probability of getting heads both times?	Probability of getting one head = 1/2. Probability of getting two heads = (1/2) * 2 = 1/4. You have a 25% chance of getting a head two times.... And 12.5% chance of getting a head 3 times.... And 6.25% chance of getting a head 4 times.... .. .. .. And 0.09765625% chance of getting a head 10 times!!! :)	1	4
If a coin is tossed twice, what is the probability of getting heads both times?	1/2 x 1/2 = 1/4. . ^_^	1	3
If a coin is tossed twice, what is the probability of getting heads both times?	(1/2) that it will lead heads once. The probability that it will like on heads again, is done like this. . (1/2) * (1/2) = (1/4)	1	4
If a coin is tossed twice, what is the probability of getting heads both times?	It's a composite probability of 2 independent events, therefore it is obtained as product of each:. . P= 0.5 x 0.5 = 0.25	1	4
If a coin is tossed twice, what is the probability of getting heads both times?	1/2 * 1/2 = 1/4. 50% * 50% = 25%. One in four.	1	4
If a coin is tossed twice, what is the probability of getting heads both times?	25% chance	1	3
If a coin is tossed twice, what is the probability of getting heads both times?	the 4 possibilities are. tt,th,ht,hh. Only one is hh.. So the probability is 1 out of 4 or 1/4 = 25%.	1	3
If a coin is tossed twice, what is the probability of getting heads both times?	2 times because each coin has 1 head or tail .. so tossing it two times gives the prob. of 1/4	1	4
If a coin is tossed twice, what is the probability of getting heads both times?	it depends... is the coin one-faced or two-faced?	0	2
If a coin is tossed twice, what is the probability of getting heads both times?	total no. of outputs = tailhead,headtail,tailtail,headhead =4. . . . so probability of getting head twice is 1/4	1	4
If a coin is tossed twice, what is the probability of getting heads both times?	One in four	1	4
If a coin is tossed twice, what is the probability of getting heads both times?	As a coin has 2 sides, the probability of getting a head is 1 in 2.. . To work out the probability of two (or more) separate events both occurring, you multiply the probability of one by the other. . . 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/4, so the probability of two heads is 1 in 4.. . In the same way you can work out the probability of 3 heads in a row as follows:. . 1/2 * 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/8. . Just remember the keep multiplying probability of each individual occurrence.	1	4

If a coin is tossed twice, what is the probability of getting heads both times?	I believe it to be one in four, which is 25% of the time, but with respect to Murphy's law, and the probability of improbability even 25% is not completely accurate, as with respect to improbability there always remains the chance that your coin will stand on its edge, and be neither, as I have put this question of yours to the test, and reasoned it out with in my mind, although the probability is not as likely that it will stop on it's edge, it is a true variable, and it earns a variable percentage rate, unless you are not factoring in that outcome and discounting that possibility as an alternative circumstance.. . I have thrown two coin tosses in my lifetime, which have resulted in the coin landing on the edge, rolling, spinning, and stopping on its edge, I apologize for not giving you a more concrete mathematical figure here as to the probability of this outcome, but I have been working on this problem since I read your question and have not completed it as of yet, although if I come to a correct conclusion I will be happy to share it with you.	1	4

What is currently the meaning of life?	the meaning of life is something that many ponder, and many have gone mad before they could ever realize the answer is not the meaning, but to live the the question. we have to live the question to realize that the answer is one we can only find in hindsight, after death we will look back upon out life and see oursleves searching for answers that we already carried in ourselves.	1	4

Why do we put up with the heresies of science?	Science believers are nothing more then a cult.  A cult is any group that has a form of godliness, but does not recognize Jesus Christ as the unique son of God.... One test of a cult is that it often does not strictly teach that Jesus is the only begotten Son of God who Himself is God manifested in the flesh.... Christian-oriented cults include the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints or Reorganized Church of Latter Day Saints (Mormons), the Worldwide Church of God, Christian Science, Unity, Unitarianism, The Way International, Rosicrucian Society of America, Bahai, Hare Krishna, Scientology, the Unification Church, and the Jehovah's Witnesses.. . We must spread the word of Evangelical Christianity to stop the demons from teaching science.	1	4
Why do we put up with the heresies of science?	Science is the search for what is true about our world.  If Christianity is true, and if science is done properly, then scientists WILL discover either that Christianity is true, or that it cannot be determined by their methods and current state of knowledge.. . Science changes, and this is what makes it great.  The science book is never closed.  If you can demonstrate that a theory is wrong, then you are welcome to do so.  You are welcome to fight the theories of science.........but in order to be effective, you must fight it with acceptable science.  You must bring evidence.. . If you say the Bible is true, then show me evidence that it is true.  If you cannot show that it is true, then why should I believe what it says, over what the Epic of Gilgamesh says?	1	3

Why do we put up with the heresies of science?	"Because we all would have starved to death or died of the plague while being bled or having holes cut in our skull to release the demon is science wasn't invented. . . Would Jesus approve of fighting something that saved countless lives or do you just not know what ""science"" actually is?"	1	3
Why do we put up with the heresies of science?	"Science is a discipline designed to help humanity raise itself above the superstitions and errors of its past primitive thinking.  It is not always practiced perfectly, but it is a logical method and works reasonably well most of the time.. . I resent your insinuation that ""true Christians""  ought to reject and ""fight"" science.  Not all followers of Christ follow the Bible mindlessly, some of us are proud of our God-given ability to think logically about things like evolution and human rights.. . Before you fight science, try to understand it.  It might suprise you."	1	3
Why do we put up with the heresies of science?	Don't bash science too much. If it weren't for science, most of us wouldn't be here right now. We'd be dead from simple cases of the flu, or even the common cold. People would die from lack of minor routine surgeries and other treatments. . . Science may seem like heresy to you, and it's certainly not infallible, but it's definitely preferable to having a quasi-literate, chronically sick society that lives like cavemen. . . Many scientists I know are religious people. Faith and science can work hand-in-hand.	1	3
Why do we put up with the heresies of science?	I am not buying your persona :-). But carry on your work with your microscope !	0	2
Why do we put up with the heresies of science?	Wow, I thought this was tongue in cheek until I saw this guy's other questions.  But I have to say that I agree.  If fundamentalists disagree with evolution because of the bible, then they should also find all science disagreeable.  If carbon dating is wrong then we don't understand enough about radiation to control nuclear energy.  Nuclear reactors are just time bombs waiting for some random burst of energy that science doesn't understand to blow them sky high.. . Modern medicine just interferes with god's plan.  Humans were fine with a lifespan in the mid-40's for the past 1,800 years.  Why do we need to live to our mid-70's?  Shame on us.	0	2
Why do we put up with the heresies of science?

Why do we put up with the heresies of science?	You, Sir, are an ignorant moron.  It just so happens that I was one of those rocket scientists of the 60s and 70s, and consider myself a Christian.  Science is nothing but the study of and the attempt to explain nature as best we can.  All nature attests to the presence of God.  Also, you now enjoy the ability to do a great many things because of science, including making an ass out of yourself on this computer-driven (read science) forum.  Get a life.	1	3
Why do we put up with the heresies of science?	What about medicine and sick people. If the bible was not so stupid, then maybe science won't always be meshing it.

For a religion that is supposedly based on the teachings of christ himself, you guys sure miss a lot of his main points. . . But i've been distracted from my main point:. Would you like to give up medicine? or your technology, like your computer or cell phone? If you don't want to give these things up, then you can't really want to ""fight science"".  Frankly, Science would probably kick your ass. . . When you have a closed mind you miss out on a lot."	1	3

how do I keep my cat from scratching my leather couch?	You have quite a few options:. 1. Spray your cat with water when you catch them doing it.. 2. Sticky Paws- www.stickypaws.com. 3. Soft Claws- www.softclaws.com. . DO NOT EVER DECLAW A CAT!!! It is the worst thing you can do to a cat. It causes nerve damage, which results in them NOT using the litterbox because it is too painful for them to bury their stuff. It also results in the cat biting (it is fully aware that it does not have claws anymore, therefore does not swat- just bites). Out of the declawed cats in my shelter, only 1 in every 4 make it up for adoption because most of them are aggressive or do not use their litterbox.

how do I keep my cat from scratching my leather couch?	I have three indoor cats... the absolute best thing that I have found for that (and to keep them out of the real Christmas trees and plants) is to keep a squirt gun handy and anytime you see them go anywhere NEAR the area, just give them a quick squirt.  It's totally harmless but it makes them think that they'll get a little 'surprise' if they go near the couch.  Plus, it's hilarious to watch.  lol . . please give it a try!  it worked for us!	1	4

how do I keep my cat from scratching my leather couch?	"Buy a SuperScratcher pad... I got mine at Wal-Mart... The SuperScratcher is a rectangular box no thicker than an average telephone book and is inexpensive: it provides an alternate ""scratching"" outlet for cats who often choose sofas, chairs, curtains and other inappropriate household surfaces to indulge their natural need to scratch.. It draws their attention by catnipwhich is already in the box.. . The SuperScratcher saved my furniture and curtains, and my cat loves the box so much I often even find him curled up asleep on top of it.. . I also occasionally trim my cats claws... but it's not very easy to do and you can't trim them too short. Once I trim them he just goes right to his scratcher to sharpen them back up though."	1	4

When you go to buy a watch, why do all the watches/clocks set to show 10:10?	talk about weird!. Just googled.. Lincoln died at 10.10. pentagon got hit at 10.10. United 93 hijacked at 10.10.. . Don't know real reason though!	1	4
When you go to buy a watch, why do all the watches/clocks set to show 10:10?	Dunno exactly.... . but it's said that 10:10 is the time at which the clock was invented/made. Therefore all the watches in shops read 10:10.	1	4
When you go to buy a watch, why do all the watches/clocks set to show 10:10?	"Aesthetics. I personally think that the 10:10 position (sometimes 10:12 or 10:08) was adopted for pictures of clocks and watches because it is symmetric and looks better. Today the symmetric positions are both aesthetic and customary. Other symmetric hand positions are also used, but not as frequently. Examples include 8:20, 8:18, and 2:50. Reviewing some Seth Thomas clock catalog illustrations, I see a gradually increasing symmetry of the hands as the catalogs progress from 1878 to 1940.. . ""We always put hands to 10.10 here and in other collections I'm responsible for. The answer is probably quite simply that it looks better, aesthetically and practically, as the clock has a 'smile' on its face (not just a marketing gimmick, it really does look better than a 'down turned mouth' at 8.20) and, as others have said, because it keeps the hands clear of signatures and other subsidiary dials. I note that not every firm uses that position in their marketing though. Synchronome, for example, appear to depict their dials at 3.00."" - Jonathan Betts. . ""The opinions I've read tend toward 'framing' the maker's name on the clock face. Viz: when the logo is placed above the center, the hands are at 10:10 but when the logo is below the center, the hands are shown at 8:20 framing the maker's name. Wristwatch advertising follows this trend."" - Les Lesovsky. . ""Thomas A. Frank wrote: '...most manufacturers trademarks are just above the center pipe, and having the hands at 10:10 causes your eye to naturally follow to the trough, thus bringing your view right to the trademark....' and often the Model name is centered under the center pipe, ruling out any hand more or less straight down (between 5 and 7). Date windows most often are at 9 or 3, and subsidiary seconds usually at 6. For aesthetic reasons you want the two hands neither nearly covering each other nor nearly in a straight line. By default the 10h10 looks pretty good."" - Fortunat Mueller-Maerki. . ""Smile"" Theory. It has been suggested that the 10:10 position is used because it resembles a smile.. . ""I too have heard the 'smile' theory, which makes some sense from the emotional marketing perspective. Equally likely is the fact that most manufacturer's trademarks are just above the center pipe, and having the hands at 10:10 causes your eye to naturally follow to the trough, thus bringing your view right to the trademark."" - Tom Frank"	1	4

When you go to buy a watch, why do all the watches/clocks set to show 10:10?	I have heard  the reason is that the hands in that position will frame the brand name of the watch, making it more noticeable. It is also symmetrical, which may seem more attractive to potential buyers.	1	4
When you go to buy a watch, why do all the watches/clocks set to show 10:10?	Maybe it's 10:10 when you looked at them. They are usually set for the correct time unless they are not running and have that little plastic thingy holding the stem out in my experience.	1	3

When you go to buy a watch, why do all the watches/clocks set to show 10:10?	"Wow, Holy analog, Batman!. This question only applies to wind-up analog watches and print advertisment.. On an analog watch face, 10:10 makes a ""Vee"" and shows the hands, the quarter-hour positions and all the numbers (with the 10 and 2 only partially obscured). Watch vendors determined that this was ""the"" way to show the faces and it became standardized as a market tradition. This has carried over as a tradition to digitals in print adds (not always, but often) showing the ""10:10"". Of course, since they are battery operated nowadays, most watches show ""correct time."""	1	4
When you go to buy a watch, why do all the watches/clocks set to show 10:10?	"I read about this somewhere!  It's because the hands sort of make a ""smiley face"" when they're at the 10:10 position, and therefore the clock looks more attractive to you, i.e. you're more likely to purchase it."	1	4

How do I get rid of static shock/electricity?	Use some conductor (Like copper wire) andmake the thing contact with some metal inserted to earth. So the charge will flow to earth.	1	3
How do I get rid of static shock/electricity?	SO MANY FALSE OR EVEN STUPPID ANSWERS UNTIL NOW !!!!. . ===================================. ===================================. ===================================.         THE GOOD ANSWER IS:. ===================================. ===================================. . . . Static energy appears when you wear plastic clothes and touch/rub plastic surfaces (like chairs, car seats, and floor).. When you touch a metal surface that IT IS CONNECTED to the ground (and only then) all the energy accumulated in you discharge suddenly.. This can be painful.. . To get rid of that static energy/charge you should discharge it slowly.. How? It is very simple:. Go to a shop that sell electronic components (parts) and buy a resistor of 100 KOhm.. It is really cheap, something like 3-10 cents (American dollar cent).. . If you are asked about the power of that resistor, your answer is: it doesn't matter. Anyway I recommend you a resistor of at least 1 Watt because it a little bit larger (2 or 3 centimeter long) and it is more difficult to loose it.. It the power of that resistor is under 1W it will be only 1 cm long and you might loose it soon in your pockets.. . THE IDEA is to keep on head/terminal of the resistor in your hand while touching the grounded object with the other end for 3-4 seconds.. This will dissipate your energy slowly and painless.. . If you still got shocked try to buy another one much bigger, something like 500 Kohm up to 1 MOhm.. . newfedra@yahoo.com. www.BionixWallpaper.com. . ===================================. ===================================. ===================================. ===================================. .. .. .. PS: as somebody mentioned above, a bracelet might work but only in time. If you accumulate energy very quickly, then it is useless.. Also TO PREVENT this problem you should buy an anti-static spray from a clothes store. But it won't last very long and might smell bad after the perfume is gone.. . . . Even e better idea: wrap a thin wire around your place/desk in invisible places.. Connect this wire to the ground through the resistor described above.. Grounded things in your house: the heating system, the water pipe, some doors.. . When you sit down you will touch that wire and the energy will be discharged slowly al the time.. The wire must not be wrapped in it's protective plastic, rubber or paint.. Buy 10 meters o unwrapped copper wire (also extremly cheap).	1	4

How do I get rid of static shock/electricity?	I would suggest a change of the chairs that you use. Most probably, you are using a chair/seat with a cover made of some synthetic material. See if you can get yourself a change of chairs to something that has a cloth cover - that should help to avoid collection of charges. Also, if possible get a metal chair that directly touches the floor. Any charge developed directly flows to the earth that way. . . However, since this option is not so feasible in a car, maybe you could try putting a piece of cloth over your seats before you use them. This will test your interior decoration skills also. :-)	1	3

How do I get rid of static shock/electricity?	You're building up static electricity either positive (+) or negative (-) charge, you're discharging it once you have touched a lower static charge object, such as cars or grounded objects such as aluminum doors(metals are connected to concrete, directly to earth), as a result of both bodies to come into potential equilibrium. These static voltages can reach 30,000 volts and up. The one you felt is only 4,000 to 7,000 volts static electricity.. . Building of static charge originates from walking, rubbing, (all events which has friction), and also on a high level of humidity.. . If you will discharge yourself, you're car will also cause a static discharge to you and/or vice versa.. . You can minimize this in an expensive way, retrofitting your car with ground connection and you, or, buy a leather gloves, which you will use always when you touch anthing or any object, especially when it is metal.	1	4

How do I get rid of static shock/electricity?	You could move to a more humid climate where static electricity is not such a problem. The dry air increases the amount of static electricity in clothing, hair, etc	1	3
How do I get rid of static shock/electricity?	well it is caused by the fact that there is less humidity that during other parts of the year. the lack of humidity means there is less static discharged to the air around you and thus more stays built up in or more properly on you.  when leaving your car you might( if you're balance is good ) try closing the car door with your foot. follow me here. as you get out you place one foot on the ground you then place you then place your other one beside it. try reaching back (with the first leg) and closing the door. this process can be refined to an art in time and it's especially handy when you've got your hands full.	1	3

How do I get rid of static shock/electricity?	Dear. When you are moving out of your car you are charged with static current due to friction between your clothes and car chair and due to your shoes which not allowing this charges to go out to the ground you keep those charges till you touch any metal so it can go out....SOLUTION..during getting out of the car keep your hand holding the metal part of the car door so as you are charged you are evacuating at the same time to car body  or  when you get out of the car hold the metal car kee and touch the car body with it you will see the spark coming out  or  use shoes with antistatic character help you to evacuate the charge to the ground when you touch it...This condition is very famous in countries with dry weather and low humedity....GOOD LUCK	1	4

How do I get rid of static shock/electricity?	i have the same problem you do, i even get shocked when I touch water.  I think it is just that we are so electric we shock everything.  I try to use a part of my arm or even the bottom of my shoe to close my car door toprevent that shock.  But when I get to a door knob, there it goes. My 1 year old is even a victim of my shocking.  I haven't tried this yet but maybe caring a static guard sheet and rubbing it on our hands could work.  Keep one in your pocket or even just on the passenger seat, so before you get out you can rub it on your hands and be static free.  Not to mention have a very fresh scent to you. (Ha)	0	2
How do I get rid of static shock/electricity?	Good thing its always humid where im at. I have never experienced anything of the sort most of you had gone through and i certainly wont touch anything 'Mental', (like what Magiwol said), to get rid of static.. . Anyway, it will take a while for static to get discharged from your body. Like what they said, those dryer things can help, but what if theres none around?. . You could cover your hands with a hanky or part of your shirt, while opening a car door or a door knob or whatever metal you would like to get your hands on. Anything that does not conduct electricity will do.. . If you still get shocked then, what are you?	1	4
How do I get rid of static shock/electricity?	"You should all be glad you don't have to shake my hand or bump into me. I walked to the front of my church to get a special sticker for childrens church, where I was teaching. When the revered held out the sticker, I reached for it and a blue flash of electricity like lightening crackled and popped like a 22. From then on if we met in the same hallway or anywhere else; he would either get as far away from me in the hall etc. or, we'd  hi 5 each other. When that happened he say, ""Gimme 5 to keep me alive.""  Believe me, I can hurt a person; I have brought people to tears with my ""electric"" personality.I hate that this happens and hurts anyone. But try this and I think you will be pleased. Take fabric softner and mix roughly half and half. If where you live is really dry, try 2/3 softner and the rest water. Place these amounts in a spray bottle. Now, spray your carpet in your home, car including upholstry. Don't saturate the fabric just mist till a bit damp. Let air dry. Do same around your office; if you work in one to. Do your chair also. Make sure you used softner in your clothes too. I have even put a little in a container to do a final rinse when doing my hair as well. You can't totally elimintate it; but this will sure help a lot.Leather car or office seats? Make a ""slip cover"" by sewing two towels together at the ends, longwise. then fold one end over about a foot and sew sides together and put on car/ office seats. Make sure the colors will work together and not clash with the surrondings. Spray with fab.softner, and you should be zap free.Never but never spray fab. softner directly on leather of any varity trust me."	1	3

If you do the later, you are taking the high road.. However, if you are really asking about the ""Hight"" road, then I confess I do not know what that means."	1	4

Animals will not stab you in the back. An animal like cats and dogs are loving creatures and were put here on this planet just like humans were. You said ""god forbid if you kick a damn dog"" well you said it ""god forbid"" so if you like kicking dogs your damned then aren't you?  Why would you want to kick a dog anyway?

You said and I quote  "" i see this with mostly white people""  The question I wonder is where did you SEE   I repeat SEE this happening?   On the Internet advertising sex with animals am I right? If you find this so nasty why are you looking for those kind of sites?

How do we get up early in the morning without alarm?	"I get up every morning between three and four O'clock in the A.M. and, I've been retired for ten years. Do you think I'd like to sleep in? you bet you sweet bippy but, my biological clock that I set about fifty-five years ago when I started school and working, keeps me going.

Why were black women abused sexually after the abolition of slavery in the US in 1865?	"""The breakup of the abolitionist coalition and the rise of a new group of black leaders in the 1840s and 1850s led black abolitionists to place a greater value on manual labor rather than moral perfection as a method of racial uplift for blacks. However, black abolitonists distinguished between meaningful skilled labor, and ""degraded"" occupations such as domestic service and waiting tables. Such distinctions grew out of a general ideology about labor in the antebellum period, rooted in republican thought, which devalued personal service occupations as not providing workers with sufficient independence from employers. Among blacks, such distinctions also grew out of the experience of slavery, in which domestic and other personal servants were more subject to the will of their masters than other workers, and at worst, were also subject to sexual abuse by them."""	1	4
Why were black women abused sexually after the abolition of slavery in the US in 1865?	"you have to think in the eras mind set . forget today . forget what you see and hear . at that era in time women in general had no rights. so a black woman had even less rights and was considered dis possible sounds hard ?. they were considered ""sorry"" like cattle. white women were thought of as possessions. at that point on time it was acceptable to beat your wife and kids . it was the mans role and considered personal. ""the family's business"". as long as no one was killed what a man did in his house was his business and no one had anything to say.. we forget much as time goes on that was what was so great before the television came about.. family's talked at diner people spoke with one another.and everyone had human contact.. people understood times past through stories passed down through generations .. now we have a hard time thinking woh was that possible ?. we have come a long way in the past 5 years . your talking about something that happened much longer.. so that is why it can be hard to comprehend the mindset.. . did this help"	1	4
Why were black women abused sexually after the abolition of slavery in the US in 1865?	"I am assuming you are referring to abuse by white men.  Although slavery was abolished, we were still treated like slaves for a long period of time.  Many slaves ended up ""working"" for there original masters.  Within this arrangement many of the women were probably abused and raped as if they were still slaves.  It wasn't a big deal back then for slave masters to impregnate young black women."	1	4
Why were black women abused sexually after the abolition of slavery in the US in 1865?	women have been abused sexually, black white asian, since the beginning of time. guys can't keep their hands off us. Perhaps they targeted black women to make a statement.	1	3
Why were black women abused sexually after the abolition of slavery in the US in 1865?	For the same reason sexual abuse goes on today, and not necessarily black women. A women is intimidated by her preditor who she believes has some sort of power over her (be it her slave master, husband, boss, landlord, even drug dealer). The end result is the sad reality called sexual abuse and it happens all over the world. But to the root of your question, black women feared white men. They were born and taught to fear them. So just because slavery was abolished, do you seriously think that they would no longer fear the men they saw rape their mothers, kill their fathers and brothers, and do it just because of the color of their skin?	1	4
Why were black women abused sexually after the abolition of slavery in the US in 1865?	Speculation but probably correct.  When Black women were owned by plantation owners they were protected by the plantation owner.   If anyone abused them or raped them then the plantation owner would hunt that person down and probably hang them.  They would certainly have all the support of the other plantation owners to protect their “property”.  . . When slavery was abolished the plantation owners no longer had “interest”.  Unfortunately the people just set free had no protection.  The police department and legal system will still the same as it was before the war.  So being an ex-slave and running to the police would probably only lead to being abused by the police.. . Developing a law or winning the war that does not take into account the ramifications will always lead to this.   Look at Iraq now, we won the war but it seems the war between the people is just starting.  Before it was kept in check by Saddam's strict enforcement.   Now freedom allows people to take vengeance on one another in a way that law enforcement cannot control.. . Mark	1	4

Why were black women abused sexually after the abolition of slavery in the US in 1865?	Black women were the least protected segment of the recently freed population and therefore easy targets for abuse and rape.. . Having been separated from husbands, their natural protectors, there was little they could do to help themselves.  Who, in the deep South, would step up to protect such helpless people?. . Remember that across all of America women of all backgrounds were being legally treated as second class citizens.. . The Civil War ended in '65 but it would be hard to prove that slavery was truly abolished at that time.   True, slaves were freed.. But the reality is that the social and personal behaviors of slavery continued well into the 20 century.	1	4

Athiests: How Did You Find The Light?	"Yes, I am happy to be an atheist. Before I ""found the light"" I was angry with god for not doing anything to help innocent children who are sick or starving to death all around the world, when I had been taught about all the miracles he used to do, and dropped ""Manna"" onto the jewish people when they needed food in the wilderness. It is really nice to know now that those are just fairytales with a few morals thrown in like Esope's fables, and not a ""captain's log"" of stuff that actually happened. It's more productive for us as humans to realize that WE need to drop food from the sky (from planes and choppers) to help those people, instead of praying for help that will never come."	1	4

Athiests: How Did You Find The Light?	"Yes, absolutely. . Rational thought and logic make life an interesting thing.  I enjoy being able to ask questions and finding answers myself.. But your context is wrong.  Atheism is not a religion that you ""follow"".  I simply do not think of it at all.  Like breathing. It is a logical thought process based on observation, it is not a way of life.. Yes, it would be nice to think that there was a higher meaning to life and the world in general, but it would also be nice to win the lottery at will.  My life is extremely happy and satisfying.  Full of love, giving, health, accomplishment, and fulfillment.  Being an athiest does not negate ""miracles"" as such, just gives them a different context.  The birth of my daughter was an amazing beautiful experience, whether I believe it is devine or not.  The experience is still the same.. And as a bonus, I dont go through life thinking the vast majority of humanity is doomed to an eternal hell.  Alot less hate in the world, when you do not believe you are right and everyone else is wrong.  I also take responsibility for my own actions and sins without blaming a higher entity. A personal responsibility that has nothing to do with reward and punishment.  Be a good person for the sake of being a good person and helping fellow humans.  Not because I am lectured to and threatened.. So yes, I am very Happy today.. . But of course you are entitled to believe what you want as well."	1	4

Athiests: How Did You Find The Light?	"A-T-H-E-I-S-M (spelled correctly) is not something that is stumbled on in the dark or in a blinding flash. To achieve rationality is a developmental process that has to overcome the mindless programming that has been shoved at you since childhood. I'm amazed that I started asking the right questions when I was eleven and even more amazed that I was able to take the ""because"" answers of religion with a jaundiced eye at such a young age. Still it took three more years before I called myself an agnostic and three hard years more before being to call myself an Atheist. Happy about it? Sometimes I envy delusionalists who think they are going to end up in some cosmic Disneyland when they die, instead of the void on non-existence, but in the end, I'm happy I do not live in the delusional haze that seems to keep them anesthetized to reality."	0	2

I share my thoughts with people that want to hear them, but I don't shove them down their throats, as I would not want it shoved down mine.. . Finally, I have never been happier in my life now that I'm an atheist.  I have a husband, a daughter, a dog, a house, two cars, two jobs...basically everything I need.  I get the most satisfaction when someone says, ""Aren't you unhappy?  Aren't you missing something in your life?"". . My answer is no...I have a fuller life that most of my Christian friends.  I have never been happier, and I am glad I chose the path that I did when I woke up at the age of 17."	1	4

why does the earth keep getting hotter and hotter every year?	Global warming caused by increasing holes in the o-zone. This is caused by pollution, such as car emmissions, and chlora-flora carbons.	1	4
why does the earth keep getting hotter and hotter every year?	Cause of Polution.	1	3
why does the earth keep getting hotter and hotter every year?	The answer about greenhouse gases is correct, but careful with the answers about ozone.  The hole in the ozone layer is a separate phenomenon caused by the release of chlorofluorocarbons, which were used in aerosol cans and cooling systems, and which are still leaking from discarded refrigeration systems despite having been banned by international treaty.. . In general, the ozone layer has thinned, resulting in an increased risk of sunburn and eventually malignant melanoma (skin cancer) worldwide, particularly for northern Europeans who have relocated to tropical and subtropical environments.  The native residents of these areas are partially protected by their melanin (darker skins).  In particular, global wind patterns have trapped chlorofluorocarbons at the poles, resulting in a much greater thinning there, and a measurable hole over Antarctica.  This phenomenon, while dangerous to our environment and to us, is entirely separate from global warming.. . Carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases work much like glass.  When visible light passes through glass, it is slowed down.  When light slows, its speed doesn't change, but its wavelength done.  It is red shifted, and the lower spectrum of visible light becomes infrared or heat.  Glass is not transparent to infrared light, so the heat cannot escape again.  This is why a car parked in the sun heats up, and why leaving the windows open a crack can keep it from getting too hot--you're leaving an escape vent for infrared light.. . To make matters worse, the heat output of the sun varies over time, and we're currently in an uptick.	1	4
why does the earth keep getting hotter and hotter every year?	The prevailing theory and evidence suggest that certain gases being released by human activity increase the rate of heat absorbtion of solar energy in the atmosphere.  These gases include C02, CH4, and others released by fossil fuel cumbustion, industrial emissions, deforestation, and to some extent, poor ecological agricultural practices.	1	4
why does the earth keep getting hotter and hotter every year?	Well I don't know if you can say it is getting hotter and hotter every year, but the trend is towards a hotter average climate. This is coined global warming, and virtually all of the climatologist attribute it to the increase of Greenhouse Gases. The way Greenhouse Gases work is that they are transparent to light in the visible spectrum yet absorb IR light. So light comes in from the Sun and heats the ground and oceans, but when that heat is radiated back out in the form of IR light it is reabsorbed by greenhouse gases and not allowed to escape into space as easily. This causes a net increase in the heat energy balance at the surface of the Earth.	1	4
why does the earth keep getting hotter and hotter every year?	It doesn't if you believe the lies we've been fed!Real reasons have been well stated, by the knowledgeable people here.Breakdown of ozone,release of gases,producing a higher temperature melting the glaciers, the melted areas are darker, thus attracting more sunlight,(Alaska) is a prime area,destruction of the forests is another,it's all tied together, and we need to change our ways for the sake of our children, and our childrens, children.	1	3
why does the earth keep getting hotter and hotter every year?	"It's the greenhouse gas (carbon dioxide) theory.  Carbon dioxide holds the heat in more, so it doesn't radiate back into space as easily.. . The carbon dioxide that used to be in the atmosphere long ago was taken in by plants and turned into solid forms of carbon through photosynthesis.  These plants containing this carbon were buried underground and became petroleum.. . Less CO2 left in the atmosphere lead to cooler temperatures.  But now, like opening ""Pandora's box,"" we are opening the ground up and allowing these carbon dioxide demons to escape from the underground hell that once confined them--to again roam the earth--ruling in terror, like they did in days of yore."	1	4
why does the earth keep getting hotter and hotter every year?	The simple answer would be pollution -> bigger ozone holes -> more sunlight come in.. . http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_warming	1	3
How did African American women get the right to Vote?	Technically, black women received the right to vote with passage of the Nineteenth Amendment in 1920 (along with all other women).  The right to vote without regard to race came with the Fifteenth Amendment in 1870.	1	4
How did African American women get the right to Vote?	throughout history women and blacks were considered under males and whites...so black women were all the way at the bottom of the list...they had to wait first for blacks to get rights....then after that they also had to wait for women to get rights...pretty crappy...	1	4
How did African American women get the right to Vote?	Amendment XV (the Fifteenth Amendment) of the United States Constitution grants voting rights regardless of race.. . The amendment is one of the post-Civil War, Reconstruction amendments. It was ratified on February 3, 1870.. . This amendment prohibits the states or the federal government from using a citizen's race, color, or previous status as a slave as a voting qualification. Its basic purpose was to enfranchise former slaves. But it was not really until the Voting Rights Act in 1965, almost a century later, that this purpose was actually achieved in all states.. . The first person to vote under the provisions of the amendment was Thomas Mundy Peterson.. . After the passage of the Thirteenth Amendment, which barred slavery, and the Fourteenth Amendment, which guaranteed former slaves citizenship, there were still fears by the Radical Republicans that sympathizers to the Confederate cause would attempt to achieve through suppression of the black vote what they could not obtain by war. No southern state had ever had a black elected official, and most southern states even prohibited the vote to freed slaves and free-born blacks. Blacks were known to be sympathetic to the Republicans thanks to their clear anti-slavery policies, and the efforts of the Republicans with Reconstruction after the American Civil War. As to the fear that southern legislatures would restrict the vote to whites as they did before the Civil War, the amendment was clearly justified and, in retrospect, the fears of the Radicals were well founded. They also saw a political opportunity to break the hold of the Democratic Party over the deep south.. . After the passage of the Fifteenth Amendment, southern blacks voted in numbers that on a per capita basis would probably exceed black political participation today. On both a per capita and absolute basis, more blacks were elected to political office during the period from 1865 to 1880 than at any other time in American history. Although no state elected a black governor during Reconstruction, a number of state legislatures were effectively under the control of a substantial African American caucus. These legislatures brought in programs that are considered part of government's duty now, but at the time were radical, such as universal public education. They also set aside all racially biased laws, even those prohibiting interracial marriage.. . Despite the efforts of groups like the Ku Klux Klan to intimidate black voters and white Republicans, assurance of federal support for democratically elected southern governments meant that most Republican voters could both vote and rule in confidence. For example, when an all-white mob attempted to take over the interracial government of New Orleans, President Ulysses S. Grant sent in federal troops to restore the elected mayor.. . However, after the close election of Rutherford B. Hayes, Hayes, in order to mollify the South, agreed to withdraw federal troops. He also overlooked poll violence in the deep south, despite several attempts by the Republicans to pass laws assuring the rights of black voters and to punish intimidation. To show the unwillingness of Congress to take any action at this time, even a bill that would have required incidents of violence only at polling places to be publicized failed to be passed. Without the restrictions, voting place violence against blacks and Republicans increased, including instances of murder. Most of this was done without any interference by law enforcement, and often even with their co-operation.. . By the 1890s, many southern states had rigorous voter qualification laws, including literacy tests and poll taxes. Some states even made it difficult to find a place to register to vote. Most of these laws were race neutral, but clearly discriminated against black voters, either through their construction or their administration. For example, most states required literacy tests, but voters were exempt if they could prove t	1	4
